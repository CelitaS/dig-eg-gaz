            <head>DISCOVERY OF HIS TOMB.</head>

            <head>an IMPORTANT find at Thebes</head>

            <p>(From our own Correspondent).
            Luxor, Sunday.</p>

            <p>A discovery of the utmost importance has
            just been made by the well-known American
            Egyptologist, Mr. Theodore M. Davis, who has
            discovered in the valley of the Tombs of the
            Kings, the tomb of Mer-en Ptah, a pharaoh
            of the 19th dynasty. The tomb is beautifully
            painted, but no antiquities were found.</p>

            <p>This pharaoh, who is also known as
            Meneptab, is thought by many to have been
            the pharaoh of the Exodus. His mummy
            was found in the tomb of Amenhotep II at
            Thebes. He suppressed the revolt of the
            Libyans, which broke out in the fifth year of
            his reign. His "Hymn of Triumph" is out
            on the back of a large stele, which is now in
            the Egyptian Museum at Thebes.</p></div>

            Captain G. Gillson, R.A., has been appointed
            subeditor for Egypt of the "Cavalry Journal,"
            a new quarterly publication, which is intended
            for the circulation of information concerning
            cavalry matters in the British and other
            armies, and to bring the various branches of
            our mounted troops, both at home and in the

            <p>"Egyptian Rubber Concessions."
            A usually wide-awake jobber in the Egyptian
            section of the Mining markets was (in London
            financial contemporary states) last week made
            the victim of an old, old hoax. Although a
            very experienced member, he was induced to
            make a market in 'Egyptian Rubber Conces-
            sions," and he must have been delegated to
            find business so brisk. The joke was well
            planned and executed. It was not long before
            the jobber found himself short of several
            hundred shares, the price being bid up against
            him, but about an hour elapsed before he
            came to realise that the concern had only an
            imaginary existence.</p>

            <p>The Shrager Bankruptcy.
            On the 19th inst. at the London Bankruptcy
            Court, a sitting for public examination was
            held under the failure of Shrager Brothers
            merchants, trading at Lloyd’s avenue, E.C.
            also at Calcutta Colombo, Singapore, Alexandria,
            and elsewhere. The debtors’ affairs are being
            wound up in bankruptcy, and the failure
            appears to be of considerable magnitude, tbe
            joint account di-closing liabilities to the
            amount of £76,899, of which £64,518 are
            expected to rank, with assets which are esti-
            mated to realise £4,089, book debts (£58,805)
            being treated as unrealisable. The deficiency
            is accounted for to the extent of £53,955 by
            an estimated loss on contracts made on beb. If
            of Schrager Brothers, of Calcutta.—The hear-
            ing was adjourned.</p></div>

            <head>TRIAL AND JUDGMENT.</head>

            <head>THE SPEECH FOR THE DEFENCE.</head>

            <p>The Alexandria Native Court was again oc-
            cupied on Sunday and yesterday with the
            proceedings against the first batch of persons
            accused of participating in the recent distur-
            bance at Alexandria.</p>

            <p>The accused were defended by Ali Bey As-
            sem, whose defence was based on the following
            points: The originators of the trouble were
            low-class Greeks and the natives were there as
            spectators. The mob, which was composed of dif-
            ferent nationalities, was not an unusual gather-
            ing, as the day was a Sunday and all the people
            were idling on that day. The natives took no part
            in the outrages under any circumstances, as
            can be seen from the fact that a small number
            of detectives was sufficient to arrest these 104
            persons, who made no resistance after the
            mob was dispersed, and while the authorities
            were holding an enquiry into the matter at the
            Menshieh Caracol. Only 22 persons of different
            nationalities were slightly injured among the
            enormous crowd, but these ware not attacked
            by the unfortunate accused, against whom
            there is no evidence. Even the detectives did
            not declare before the Court that the accused
            had injured people. The witnesses for the defence
            spoke the truth, while no other witnesses could
            charge these 104 natives with committing
            any crime. Article 207 of the Penal Code, which
            the Parquet required to be taken as a base
            fur a verdict against the accused, was not appli-
            cable in the case of these men. There people
            gathered together in the Grand Square out of
            curiosity. If there had been any fanaticism
            the disorder could not have been suppressed
            with such ease by a small body of police, nor
            would a fire hose have been sufficient to
            disperse them. The detectives who arrested
            these 104 persons out of a crowd of 15,000
            people could not identify them as the real
            evildoers. Public security in Alexandria has
            never been menaced, nor must some of the
            European newspapers be believed, who for their
            own purposes have misled their readers by
            stating that fanaticism was at the bottom of
            the outbreak. The question is very simple. Some
            Greeks, under the aegis of the Capitulations,
            fired at one another on a Sunday, when most
            people have nothing to do. A crowd of sight-
            seers gathered together, composed of men and
            women of every race and nation, in order to
            see what was going on, and the upshot was "a
            storm in a teacup."</p>

            <p>The above was the gist of the speech of
            the counsel for the defence.</p>

            <p>The Parquet called upon the Court to punish
            the accused in accordance with Article 207 of
            the Penal Code, and in the case of those who
            had previous convictions against them, in
            accordance with Articles 48 and 49, and the
            boys in accordance with Article 61 of the
            same code.</p>

            <p>At 7.46 p.m. yesterday evening the Court
            gave its judgment on the 104 accused, acquit-
            ting 28, sentencing 53 to three months' im-
            prisonment with hard labour, 13 to six
            months' imprisonment with hard labour, 3 t0
            be whipped with ten strokes each (these being
            boys), and 7 to twelve months' imprisonment
            with hard labour.</p></div>

            <div type= "NEW ORGAN FOR ST.GEORGE'S">
              <head>NEW ORGAN FOR ST. GEORGE'S</head>

            <p>The new organ, the gift of the congregation
            worshipping in H.B.M.'s Garrison Church of
            St. George, Mustapha Pasha, in 1904-5, was
            dedicated to the service of Almighty God and
            for the use of the Church of England troops,
            on Friday last, at a special service, by the Rev.
            F. B. N. Norman-Lee, C.F. and chaplain in
            charge. Canon Ward read the lesson and gave
            a very helpful address on verse 6 of Psalm 95.
            Alter the service Mr. Heaton, organist of St.
            Mark’s, gave a recital of seven sacred pieces,
            showing the beautiful combination of the
            various stops.</p>

            <p>The organ has a rich and full tone, and its
            sound was fully appreciated by the congregation.
            It is of tubular pneumatic action throughout,
            and has a double bass (Casson’s patent), which
            enables any one to play the pedal notes on the
            key-board, the lowest note only sounding. The
            effect of a second manual is obtained by the
            melodic stop, whereby the melody of a hymn
            or voluntary is made to stand out above the
            accompaniment. The entire organ has been
            specially constructed to suit the climate.</p></div>

            <div type= "ZIZINIA THEATRE">
              <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE</head>

            <p>On Saturday last the third performance of
            La Tosca was given and drew, as usual, a vast
            and highly appreciative audience. It was an
            excellent representation from first to last, one
            calculated to cause ecstacies of rapturous
            emotion. Signs. Bellincioni overpowered us by
            her forcible and gifted acting, coupled with
            exquisite singing, a combination which never
            fails to convey the pathos which this difficult
            role demands. Her notes were pure and pene-
            trating as ever, though not quite so powerful
            as on the last occasion we witnessed this opera,
            and for this the damp weather will no doubt
            have been to blame. Sig. Palet, as Mario,
            again sang with fervour, dignity, and distinction,
            while Sig. Polese repeated his remarkably fine
            interpretation of the heavy part of Scarpia.
            Sig Gisnoli took great pains to give full effect
            to the role of the Sagrestano. The orchestra,
            under Sig. Zuccani, left nothing to be desired.</p></div>

            <head>THE WEATHER COLD.</head>

            <head>FESTIVITIES AT THE HOTELS.</head>

            <p>At Cairo on ’Xmas Day the usual services
            were held at the Protestant and Roman Ca-
            tholic churches, and in the evening a small
            dance was given at Shepheard’s, where every-
            thing went as merrily as the date demanded
            and dancing lasted till very late. The banks
            were dosed, the British Government officials
            took holiday, and the Europeans in general
            affected to be satisfied with the weather on
            the ground that 'Xmas ought to be cold.</p>

            <p>On 'Xmas Eve an imposing ’Xmas Tree was
            to be seen in the Grand Continental Hotel.
            The little ones were delighted and the grown
            ups enjoyed a small dance that followed to
            the full. The ball-room was crowded and
            dancing lasted till those present could wish
            "a merry ’Xmas" to one another before they
            went home.</p>

            <head>SHEPHEARD’S CHRISTMAS TREE.</head>

            <p>A large and merry crowd of children with
            a still larger attendance of "grown-ups" collect-
            ed in the outer hall of Shepheard’s Hotel on
            Sunday afternoon to await the drawing aside
            of the curtains and the revelation of a magni-
            ficent Christmas Tree in the "Egyptian Hall.”
            From half-past four to half-past five the guests
            arrived in ever-increasing numbers, and save
            for the occasional protest of a few infant
            voices at not being allowed immediate entrance
            to the fairy-laud within, all were gay and
            happy from beginning to end. But the infants
            turned from teats to cries of enjoyment and
            babbling laughter as the curtains parted and
            the throng slowly pressed into the hall and
            surrounded the gorgeously decorated and
            illuminated tree, and tiny hands were stretch-
            ed out to the master of the ceremonies to
            receive a coveted ticket which would ensure a
            memento of this Christmas party. The presents
            were laid out in the billiard room, the tables
            of which were burdened with books and toys of
            every description (without even a word of protest
            from their guardian angel, Percy), and every
            little guest departed with a heart gladdened
            by a beautiful gift. The Tzigane orchestra played
            selections of music during the afternoon, and
            the buffets, which were abundantly furnished
            with teas, cakes, ices, and all sorts of good
            things, were well patronised. Mr. Baehler ana
            most generously, and his party was greatly
            enjoyed by the several hundreds of guests
            who were present.</p></div>

<div type= "XMAS AT MENA">
            <head>XMAS AT MENA.</head>

            <p>Seldom or never has the terrae of Mena
            House Hotel been so crowded as on the
            afternoon of 'Xmas Eve. It was really sur-
            prising when everybody is supposed to be up
            by the Nile, to find such a large gathering of
            smart people at Mena House. At 4.8 p.m.
            the charming dining-hall was filled with a
            select audience for the carol singing by
            the staff choir. Unfortunately, however, they
            were unable to complete the programme, which
            consisted of six items, on account of the well-
            deserved encores of the carol singers. These
            quaint old German songs were alone well
            worth the trip to Mena, and the zither accom-
            paniment and the "echo" effect of "Teure
            Heimat" were very good. The dining hall
            itself with its 'Xmas Tree and the illuminated
            models of the Sultan Hassan Mosque and
            some ancient temple produced, with the
            candles and electric light, quite a fairy scene.</p></div>

            <head>CYRANO DE BERGERAC.</head>

            <p>It is a distinct pleasure to be able to attempt
            a serious criticism instead of the usual resume
            of the play and list of the actors on to whose
            names are tacked "sustained the role of," "his
            known verve," etc. For the performance of
            Cyrano will quite bear criticism, even compari-
            son,to a certain degree, with more famous repre-
            sentations of the same play, in Paris. It is a
            play with two parts—possibly three, if we count
            Ragueneau, and it proved in consequence not
            beyond the reach of the company. Mme Moreno
            played Roxane, and achieved most accurately
            the exact "precieuse plus beauty" note: a
            thankless note indeed hered for it allows of
            very little passion or emotion: it has but
            affectation and a certain delicate egoism. M
            Daragon was Cyrano, and after the first two
            acts proved good; in the balcony scene, the
            journey to the moon, and the last act of all he
            was really excellent. The ballads duel in the
            first act was well done: but for the greater
            part of this and the second, he missed, or
            exaggerated, his chances: he suggested the
            schoolboy anxious to get through his Virgi
            repetition, or on the other hand he relied on
            one or two intonations to carry off all points.
            Now the points all through are many, subtle,
            various; one has only to see Coquelin to
            discover that. His gestures were good all
            through; but the “make-up," except in the
            last act, was not at all right; where was the
            nose. Scarcely in evidence, and certainly not
            "stalking before me, half a league ahead.” The
            other parts were good after their kind except .
            de Guiche. M. Monteux lacked dignity and
            restraint and was too excited for the "grand
            seigneur" he was supposed to represent. The
            staging of the "siege of Arrus" scene was not
            good; and the effect of the supers charging
            down the steps was absurd. It is some six years
            since we saw it in Paris, but if we remember
            right the supers hardly appeared at all; only
            their heads showed, the Gasoons' post being
            on an eminence above them. Well, to sum up,
            it might have been much worse, and even if it
            wasn’t “Paris," it was safely above the "provin-
            cial" mark.</p></div>

            <p>Your Highness, — I have the honour to
            present this letter of credence from the Presi-
            dent, accrediting me to the Egyptian Govern-

            I am charged to renew to Your Highness the

            and respect with which the President and the
            people of the United States regard this wonder-

            American representative in Cairo, and I ask,
            and feel sure that I shall receive, the support
            and encouragement of your Highness in the
            care which I shall give to American interests
            in Egypt, commercial and otherwise. Allow
            me to offer my best wishes for the health and
            happiness of Your Highness, and for the pros-

            teen kuttabs will soon be ready for use in the
            near future for our markaz. The distribution
            of grants-in-aid to the fikis and arifs of the
            Akhmin kuttabs took place on Wednesday
            in the hall of the markaz, under the presidency
            of the Moudir of Guirgeh, Ibrahim Bey Na-

            <p>The moudir delivered an address to the

            in the surrounding villages and exhorted

            Last Monday was appointed for the distribution

            The moudir spoke for about half an hour and
            thanked the notables of the Charkieh province
            for their generosity. The inspector of kuttabs,
            the Omdeh of Bakkashin, and a clever fiki
            made excellent speeches on the benefits of
            kuttabs. The grants-in-aid were then given
            by the moudir to the fikis, who were very g’ad
            to receive them.</p></div>

            <head>11TH MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS</head>

            <head>AFFAIR SENT BEFORE TRIBUNALS.</head>

            <p>At 3.30 p.m. on Saturday the eleventh
            meeting of the creditors of the Société de-
            Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d'Egypte took
            place at the Commercial Chamber of the
            Mixed Tribunals Cairo, under the presidency
            of Judge Tuck. Me. Carton de Wiart, whose
            lameness prevented him from rising, was grant-
            ed permission to speak sitting, and opened the
            ball with a plea for a farther postponement.
            He stated that the proposals made under the
            concordat had been sent to Paris and that a
            wire had been received from Paris begging for
            a postponement of their publication till the
            19th inst. Since then certain modifications
            had been insisted on by the shareholders,
            and matters were not yet finally settled. This
            being so, he begged for a week's postponement,
            and expressed the hope that the juge-commis-
            would be induced, in deference to the wishes of
            the whole body of creditors, to withdraw from
            his determination already expressed to send
            the affair before the Tribunals.</p>

            <p>Me. St. Plancat and Me. Bakri, representing
            Me. Padoa Bey, joined in the demand, but
            Judge Tuck was inexorable as Rhadamanthus.
            He remarked that the cessation of payments
            took place on September 7. The judgment
            authorising the application of the concordat
            préventif was given on September 19. The
            first meeting of creditors took place on October
            4, when the first report of the experts was read.
            The Sucreries asked for a postponement on
            account of the shareholders’ meeting. The
            next meeting accordingly took place on
            October 18, and since then matters had made
            no progress, in spite of eleven meetings. Conse-
            quently he saw no alternative but to send the
            case before the Tribunal on Saturday next.</p>

            <p>The avocats protested in vain. "You will
            bring your proposals before the Tribunal,”
            quoth the judge, “far more rapidly. Here we
            have nothing but requests for new postpone-
            ments and promises for the next time, but I
            have not had any communication of the pro-
            posals made to me." Me. Carton de Wiart
            remarked that the proposals had been sent to
            Paris. Judge Took observed that they
            had not been made before him. Me. St.
            Plancat then asked whether the proposals
            might be discussed before the Tribunal. An
            emphatic negative from Judge Tuck, who
            pointed out that the Tribunal simply had to
            decide whether the company was to be ad-
            mitted to the privileges of the concordat pre-
            ventif. For his part he would not keep the
            responsibility of the affair on his shoulders for
            48 hours.</p>

            <p>The greffier, M. Zigliara, then read the
            following note from the experts, Sir W. Will-
            cocks, Fourneron Bey, and Prof. Sampaolo :-</p>

            <p>Monsieur le Juge Commis,</p>

            <p>Nous avons l'honneur de vous informer que
            nons avons fait notre estimation du bilan dec
            Sucreries en admettant qu'avant la fin de
            novembre l'avenir de cette Société serait défini-
            tivement résolu.</p>

            <p>Les renvois successifs demandés font que
            nous sommes á fin décembre et qu'auoune dé-
            cision n'a été prise.</p>

            <p>Nous considéron que la culture de la canne
            pour l'exercice 1906 1907 est déja compromise.
            car les cultivateurs ne peuvent pas faire des
            arrangements pour les cultures de l'anuée pro-
            chaine, sans ê re certains que lears productions
            seront schetées.</p>

            <p>Nous vous avons d'ailleurs monsieur le juge
            commis, mis an courant de cerre situation dans
            notre première entrevue en octobre dernier.</p>

            <p>Nous croyons donc devoir vous informer que
            notre estimation des usines, matériel et pièces
            de rechange, etc. a été fixée pensant qu'une
            décision définitive serait prise immédiatement
            après le dépôt de notre troisième rapport; mais
            industriellement parlant ces prix devraient
            déjà être diminués et si cette décision devait
            encore tarder, la valeur industrielle des usines,
            etc. deviendrait fort deuteuse, à moins que
            MM. les controleurs et administrateurs, ayant
            pris en considération l’avis que nous avons
            donné le 23 novembre, aient déjà traité avec
            les propriétaires de la Hante-Egypte afin d’as-
            surer aux usines de la Société la canne néces-
            saire et en quantité sufficante pour une période-
            de 4 années.</p></div>

<div type= "PICTURE EXHIBITION">
            <head>PICTURE EXHIBITION.</head>

            <p>On Saturday last M. Warton Mahokian open-
            ed the exhibition of his paintings at the Immeu-
            ble Bitter in Opera-square, Cairo, and though
            the weather was bitterly cold and rain fell
            occasionally, quite a number of people visited
            the rooms, where there were over a hundred oil
            paintings on view. Though all of these were not
            to our taste, they were all well painted, and it
            was evident that the work had been done by a
            real artist. Seascapes were the principal fea-
            tures of the exhibition and the painting of sea
            scenes certainly seem to be M. Mahokian’s
            forte, whilst of his landscape his winter scenes
            were the best. Of these latter, two were espe-
            cially effective and realistic, a winter’s evening
            in Russia and a similar scene in the environs
            of Berlin (Nos. 84 and 71), and of other land-
            scapes a picture of a brigands’ resting place in
            the Caucasus (No. 47) was remarkable for its
            boldness and excellent colour effects; there
            was also a very fine painting of a woodland
            scene (No. 11) in which the colouring was very
            true to nature. Among the seascapes there were
            several fine sunsets, notably on the Jutland
            shores (No. 24) and on the Swedish shores
            (No. 94), and some splendid paintings of
            stormy seas. We certainly recommend our read-
            ers to pay this excellent exhibition a visit.</p></div>

            <p>On Friday, 15th inst., a football match was
            played between Boulac Railway Institute and
            the R.E. The home team won the toss and de-
            fended Embabeh end. There were considerably
            more than 150 spectators on the club veran-
            dah. The play during the first half was of a
            very even character and neither side scored.
            Twenty minutes after the restarting the R.E.
            had the good fortune of being awarded a
            penalty kick, from which they scored. The
            visitors added another goal before the game
            was over, and thus were left victors by 2-0.
            A heavy wind, which at periods amounted to
            a gale, blew during the second half, and
            greatly hindered accurate football.</p></div>
