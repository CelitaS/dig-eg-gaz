            <p>Khartoum-Kassala Road.
            The Sudan Government is constructing a
            route from Khartoum to Kassala.</p>

            <p>A Foundling.
            A newly born child was found by the police
            near Mustapha Pasha yesterday and removed
            to	hospital.</p>

            <p>National Bank of Egypt.
            M. Armando Mustaki has been appointed
            manager of the sub-agency of the National
            Bank of Egypt in the Midan quarter of Alex-
            andria.</p>

            <p>Burned to Death.
            A native girl of 6, diving in the Custom
            house quarter, was burned to death yesterday
            through her clothes catching fire from a
            candle which she was holding in her hand.</p>

            <p>Fire in Cairo.
            A fire brook out in a home above Messrs.
            Walker and Meimarachi’s establishment in
            the Esbekish quarter of Cairo yesterday, but
            was rapidly extinguished by the Fire Brigade.</p>

            <p>Mena House Case.
            The claim to pre-emption brought by Dr.
            Rifky and the Princess, his wife, against Mr.
            Nungovich in regard to the purchase of Mena
            House Hotel came before the Cairo Mixed
            Court on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Railway Fatality.
            To save a third-class fire from Cairo to Suez,
            a	native got on the roof of a carriage of the
            train which left Bab-el-Hadid station at 7 a.m.
            on Saturday. At Benha his head came into
            collision with the bridge and he was killed on
            the spot.</p>

            <p>International Chamber of Commerce.
            The International Chamber of Commerce at
            Cairo met last night to elect a president in
            place of M. Leroux, resigned. Mr. Scott-
            Dalgleish, vice-president, was elected president
            by 12 votes out of 18 present, and Mr. Dessalles
            D’Epinoix was elected vice-president.</p>

            <p>Quadrille Dance Party.
            A quadrille dance party will be given by
            the warrant officers, staff sergeants, and
            sergeants of the 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers in
            the Mess-room, Mustapha, on Monday, 1st
            January, dancing to commence at 8 p.m.
            Invitation tickets most be presented at the
            door.</p>

            <p>A Good Scheme.
            The Government proposes to supplement
            each year the Cassel charity by the establish-
            ment of one or more permanent ophthalmic
            hospitals, until every moudirieh shall have its
            own hospital. One will be built next year for
            a sum of L.E. 4,000. The annual charge will
            be about L.E. 5,000.</p>

            <p>Union Artistique Francaise.
            The above society will give a dramatic per-
            formance in their hall in Stamboul-street this
            evening, commencing at 9. The programme
            consists of three parts, i.e., La Femme
            a conference in one act, Monsieur Badin, a
            one-act comedy by Courteline, and Les Boulin
            grins, also a one-act comedy by Courteline.</p>

            <p>New British Club.
            Donations of £5 each in aid of the founding
            of the new British Club at Alexandria have
            been received from the London and Lancashire
            Life Assurance Co. and the General Fire and
            Accident Assurance Corporation. It is to be
            hoped that the other insurance companies will
            follow this excellent example.</p>

            <p>Appointment for Dr. Sandwith.
            Dr. Sandwith has been appointed Lecturer
            on Tropical Diseases in St. Thomas’s Medical
            School. Dr. Sandwith’s wide experience of the
            subject should be a sufficient guarantee, if it
            were necesary, for the distinct advantage
            which St. Thomas’s students in the future
            will derive by the addition to their teaching
            staff of so eminent an authority as Dr. Sand-
            with. Every London Medical School in the
            near future will be compelled to have a
            Lecturer on Tropical Diseases, and this is not
            surprising when we come to consider that
            each hospital sends a large number of its old
            students into the Services, and to practise
            abroad. It is, therefore, essential for these
            men to have at least some idea of the nature
            of the diseases which are commonly met with
            in the Tropics.</p></div>

            <head>PUBLIC BUILDINGS EXPENDITURE.</head>

            <p>In his Note on the 1905 Budget, the Financial
            Adviser says :—
            Roughly speaking, it may be said that Egypt
            is actually spending from L.E. 300,000 to
            L.E. 400,000 annually on public buildings ;
            not, I think, an extravagant sum, having re-
            gard to the revenue of the country and the
            fact that everything has to be provided ab
            initio, hospitals, post offices, prisons, asylums,
            schools, police stations, to say nothing of Gou-
            vernorats, and other Government buildings of
            practically every description.</p>

            <p>Of course in the above figures are not in-
            cluded great works of public utility of a
            remunerative nature, which are charged to
            Reserve Fund.</p></div>

            As to penny postage between Egypt and
            the United Kingdom, the Financial Adviser
            says :—"For years past the Egyptian Go-
            vernment has been urging the adoption of
            this reform, but had hitherto failed to shake
            the non possumus attitude of the British
            portal authorities.”</div>

              <head>THE COST OF THE ARMY.</head>

            <p>In remarking on the increase in the budget
            of the Ministry of War Sir Vincent Corbett
            says:—</p>

            <p>L.E 50,000 represents a portion of Army
            expenditure hitherto refunded by the Sudanese
            Government and which will for the future be
            borne by Egypt. Seeing that the Egyptian
            Army in the Sudan is employed to all intents
            and purposes in guarding the Egyptian frontier
            and that its movements are dictated by Egyp-
            tian interests, it seemed unfair any longer to
            burden the nascent revenue of the Sudan with
            so heavy a charge. The sum thus set free
            will be employed in the interior development
            of the country, thus hastening the day, not, I
            am confident, very far distant, when the re-
            venue of the Sudan will not only suffice for its
            wants, but enable it to make a return on the
            considerable sums invested by Egypt in that
            country.</p></div>

            <p>He criticises The Caisse de la Dette for
            having only reduced its expenses by L. E.
            2,500 in the following strong terms:—</p>

            <p>It is regrettable that the last named institu-
            tion should not have seen its way to effecting
            still larger economies, as its work is now
            practically limited to the "payment of the
            coupon out of sums automatically paid into
            its coffers by the State.</p></div>

            <div type= "MUNICIPAL COMMISSIONS">
              <head>MUNICIPAL COMMISSIONS.</head>

            Sir Vincent makes the following remarks on
            the provincial commissions : —
            The local Municipal Commissions, which
            constituted a sort of middle term between
            governmental and municipal control of local
            business, are working farly well, but owing to
            the regime of the Capitulations, which hampers
            local reform at every turn, they are unable
            to develop as satisfactorily as could be wished.
            The privileges of foreigners render local taxa-
            tion to any reasonable extent an impossibility,
            with the result that there is an ever-increasing
            demand under this head for aid from the funds
            of the central Government.</div>

            <head>THE POSTAL TARIFF.</head>
            The "Kölnische Zeitung" publishes a com-
            munication which, although dated from Cairo,
            probably emanates from Berlin, regarding a
            readjustment of the postal tariff between Ger-
            many and Egypt. According to this communi-
            cation, the Egyptian Government has entered
            into communication with other countries for
            the purpose of bringing about a reduction of
            its postal tariff, similar to that recently arrang-
            ed with England in order to show that Egypt
            has not become a British colony. The German
            Government is now considering the matter.
            Probably penny postage will be introduced
            between Germany and Egypt.</div>

            and a very enjoyable evening was spent by

            This hotel has been well patronised up till

            received for January. The great improvements
            which have been effected at the Savoy under

            <head>THE PAST YEAR EVENTFUL.</head>

            <p>Mr. James Currie, Director of Education in
            the Sudan, and Principal of the Gordon
            Memorial College at Khartoum, reporting on
            the work of the institution for 1904, makes
            mention of the great loss the collnge has
            sustained by the death of Mr. Alfred Spalding
            Harvey, the hon. secretary, and of his own
            indebtedness to Mr. Harvey’s sagacity  and
            wide knowledge of men and things. The past
            year, he says, has been rather an eventful one,
            and several important decisions have been
            taken, though these perhaps may be said to
            represent the development of exiting agencies
            and do not constitute fresh departures. The
            college, apart from the laboratories, as has
            been explained in previous reports, has so far
            been divided into three sections: a Primary
            School, a Training College for Schoolmasters
            and Judges in the Mohamedan Courts, and the
            instructional workshops. The Primary School,
            attended by about 180 boys, has now assumed
            a final form. The curriculum, in the event of a
            a boy being unable to carry his education
            further, extends over four years, and is calculat-
            ed to fit him to fill some minor Government
            post, such as junior telegraphist, petty clerk,
            or land measurer. Apart from the normal
            increase of numbers the only point worthy of
            special notice is the prosperity of the boarding-
            house. This is now quite fall, some 25 boys be-
            ing in residence, of whom all but two are genuine
            inhabitants of the Sudan and many of them
            members of very well-known and influential
            families. The Military School, intended for
            Sudanese cadets, prospective officers in the
            black battalions, is now open and appears to
            have made a good beginning. It has been
            liberally treated in the natter of staff. The
            Training College has also prospered, and the
            progress reported in last year’s report has been
            well sustained. By the end of 1906 it will be
            possible to judge whether or not the ex-
            periment is going to be successful and whe-
            ther these young sheikhs have during their
            period of training acquired sufficient know-
            lege of Mohamedan law to administer it
            efficiently, and sufficient general culture to
            conduct that administration in accordance with
            the principles that must obtain in all countries
            where British influence is paramount. Every-
            thing possible is being done by the staff of
            lecturers to make the experiment a success,
            and one can only patiently watch results.
            The object of the workshops is to provide
            practical instruction in carpentering, fitting,
            smith’s work, moulder’s work, cotton ginning,
            and a primary stage of mechanical engineering,
            which includes the management and repair of
            oil and steam engines with electricity and
            water pressure as adjuncts, pumping machinery,
            and turning. Ultimately only boys who have
            passed through the Elementary Vernacular
            Schools will be admitted, but at present the
            supply of these is too small to fill the work-
            shops, and many boys have been allowed to
            enter whose general education does not come
            up to the standard required. In addition to
            their practical work all the boys spend six
            hours a week continuing their previous educa-
            tion. It is Mr. Currie’s opinion that consequent
            on the general policy of the Sudan and Egyp-
            tian Governments the economic development
            of the Sudan is likely to be more rapid than
            anyone four years ago could have considered
            possible.</p>

            <p>Sir Reginald Wingate, in forwarding lht|
            report to the Earl of Cromer, says that a very
            important step has been taken in initiating
            a system of secondary education and	starting a
            small engineering school for the training of over-
            seers of works and land surveyors. The college is
            fortunate in having the services of a very
            competent instructor in Mr. Rhodes. The in-
            vestigation work performed in the "Wellcome”
            Laboratories under the able direction of Dr.
            Andrew Balfour during the past year has been of
            increasing value and interest, more especially
            in regard to the causes of sleeping sickness,
            both in human beings and in animals. In
            this connection the recent journey of Dr.
            Sheffield Neave on the Upper Nile and in the
            Bahr el Ghazal should furnish further valuable
            information. The chemical analyses by Dr.
            Beam of the waters of the various rivers in
            the Sudan are also of considerable interest
            and importance.</p></div>

            <head>AMATEUR PANTOMIME.</head>

            <head>A SEASONABLE PERFORMANCE.</head>

            <p>It was a happy idea that led the members of
            the E. T. C. Mess at Suez to give so season-
            able and enjoyable an entertainment as a
            pantomime on Boxing Day. The subject chosen
            was Ali Baba, described as a pantomime pot
            pourri in 2 acts; but far from being the old
            story, it devolved itself into a topical and
            distinctly humorous legend from the pen of
            Mr. O. D. Harris. Music was introduced
            throughout, and the parodies on well-known
            songs were much appreciated.</p>

            <p>The story, which deserves mention if only
            for its originality, is briefly this: Ali Baba, the
            captain of the 40 thieves, comes down from the
            Attaca mountains, where he lives, in order to
            smuggle some hashish from a ship due that
            day. Unfortunately, on his way from the hills,
            his motor breaks down and he is forced to put
            up at the Suez Gulf Club, where he is made
            much of in the guise of a stranger, and getting
            into conversation with Aladdin, the coastguard
            chief, Ali Baba learns the password "Open
            Sesame," which will enable him to pass the
            sentinels along the docks road on his return
            from the 14th of July celebrations at Port
            Tewfik, the occasion he has chosen for smuggling
            the booty. The second act discovers Ali Baba
            at the dance, but in a sore plight, for he has
            forgotten the password, but he manages after
            much difficulty in his conversation with a
            French lady to induce her to take a small parcel
            he resourcefully names chocolates. Just aa Ali
            is kissing his hand in tender farewell to his
            innocent accomplice, his wife Morgiana turns
            up and charges her husband with infidelity.
            Ali’s explanations fail to convince the injured
            Morgiana, who straightway goes to the autho-
            rities for a divorce, when Ali’s calling as a
            desperado is soon revealed. Circumstantial
            evidence, however, foils to convict Ali Baba,
            and his fair accomplice has passed through the
            canal on her errand in a special tug. Pursuit
            is apparently useless, for we learn in the con-
            cluding lines that the famous waterway is closed
            owing to the explosion of the Chatham, and we
            hope for the sake of the story that the State
            railways did not exist in the days of Ali Baba
            and his forty thieves.</p>

            <p>As regards the individual artists, Mr. Dug-
            more, as Cinderella, repeated his former suc-
            cesses in the role of the "giddy young thing"
            of the fairer sex, whose game of bumple-puppy
            in the first act can only be described as "great."
            The lengthy role of Aladdin was made much
            of by Mr. G. A. Evans, who fully entered into
            the humorous side of the arduous duties of a
            conscientious coastguard official. Mr. Menzies,
            described on the programme as the wife of the
            deceased Blue Beard, was quite a fascinating
            if youthful creature, but we do not wish to
            enquire at what age this charming damsel
            became allied to her faithless husband. As
            Jack the Giant Killer, Mr. F. W. Hamilton
            showed much cleverness in dealing with the
            awkward situations brought about by his
            zealous compatriot, Aladdin. Mr. Counsell, as
            Morgiana, and Mr. Mansell, as Friday, under-
            took minor parts, but far from casting any
            reflection on their capabilities let it be said
            that they were quite up to the standard
            of Mr. Harris’s supporters. There only remains
            Mr. O.D. Harris in the title role. We cannot
            say too much of his rendering of Ali Baba
            and his two songs. " The captain of the 40
            thieves " and the " Local Limericks " intro-
            duced in the second act, created roars of
            laughter. We think it a pity that Mr.
            Harris does not find wider scope for his
            energies.</p>

            <p>The piece was well mounted and the effec-
            tive scenery was due to the clever brush of
            Mr. G. A. Evans. The costumes, especially
            those of the female characters, lacked nothing
            in style, and Mme Gasser is to be congra-
            tulated on her work. Other dresses and wigs
            were by W. Waller of London.</p></div>

            The weather at Suez is exceptionally cold
            this year. A few days ago snow was visible
            on the highest peaks of the Attaka mountains,
            about 20 miles south of Suez. This was re-
            ported by several homeward bound steamers,
            and the phenomenon was visible with a teles-
            cope from Suez.</div>

            (From our correspondent).

            Helouan, Wednesday.
            The prospects for the races are bright, and
            the arrangements are practically complete
            already. The course, which is very wide in
            extent, is in fine condition, and extensive im-
            provements have been carried out in the
            enclosure behind the hotel for the comfort of
            spectators and the convenience of all concerned
            in the races. The grand stands afford a splen-
            did view of the whole course, while the issue of
            each contest will be apparent to all without
            the slightest difficulty. I also understand that
            special train arrangements have been made
            for the day by the railway company.</div>

            <div type= "SCARCITY OF HOUSES">
              <head>SCARCITY OF HOUSES.</head>

            In spite of the fact that up to the present
            the season has not been up to the average, it
            is reported that visitors desirous of renting
            houses in Helouan are in several cases unable
            to find the necessary accommodation. Some
            residents prophesy that in future visitors to
            Helouan will be confined to those requiring
            the benefits of the sulphur baths, while others
            will go on to Luxor and Assouan. Whether
            that will be the case or not in the future,
            at present there is a demand for houses which
            the provision is not able to supply. New
            houses are being built in several parts of the
            town and others are being enlarged, so that
            soon there ought to be a supply equal to the
            demand. During the present week, American
            and other visitors have begun to arrive, and
            rooms have been engaged in advance by many
            who have already gone to Assouan.</div>

            <div type= "MA FISH">
              <head>“MA FISH."</head>

            Helouan offers opportunities for an enter-
            prising fishmonger able and willing reasonably
            to supply demands daily. We are not altoge-
            ther left without fish, of course, and the prin-
            cipal establishments can always obtain supplies
            from Cairo, but those who buy locally have
            sometimes to content themselves with very
            coarse fish or to go without any at all. Some
            of the gentlemen who tell fish stories in the
            hotels might turn the tables on those in-
            credulous persons who smile at them, by
            turning their attention to this matter now
            and then. People could not then say "ma
            fish," for the fish would be there!</div>

            The band which plays selections of music
            in Helouan on Sundays undoubtedly breaks
            the monotony of life here, but until one
            becomes habituated to music so plentiful in
            what was formerly called discord, one some-
            how cannot help preferring the monotone to
            many tones.</div>

            'Xmas was celebrated at the Tewfik Palace
            Hotel in the good old English fashion. The
            larger hall was decorated with flags and ever-
            greens and a motto, "Merry 'Xmas to All."
            An excellent dinner was served at 7.30, after
            which there was a Cindalerla dance, one or
            two veterans being well to the front. An
            Italian string band "played during and after
            dinner. Among the many guests we noticed
            that Dr. and Mrs. Bentley entertained a large
            party, Miss Smail a party of 4, Mr. Wyllie a
            party of 4, and Mr. Grant also entertained a
            few friends.</div>

              <head>'XMAS AT MENA.</head>

            <p>’Xmas Day brought quite a crowd of Cairo
            people to Mena House Hotel for luncheon and
            tea, but the ’Xmas dinner was the crowning
            point of the day. The well-known dining-hall
            was tastefully decorated with evergreens,
            and almost gave one the impression of being
            in a palm garden. Little coloured lamps were
            studded all over the large and small galleries,
            and happy parties one after another entered
            the fairy scene with the sound of soft music
            greeting them. We will not dwell on the
            details of the excellent dinner that was served,
            but we must, at least, mention the fact that
            when the electric light was switched off and
            the ice brought in illuminated, the visitors
            and guests staying at the hotel, with one
            accord, broke into hearty applause. After the
            dessert the choir of the hotel staff gave '"Teure
            Heimat" by special request of the visitors,
            and, if anything, did better than on 'Xmas Eve.</p>

            <p>Mr. Sheldon Amos had a party of 10 for
            dinner, Mr. Royle a party of 6, Mr. John Ross
            one of 7, and Dr. Wakeling, the popular resi-
            dent physician of Mena House, a party of 24,
            besides many others.</p>

            <p>On Boxing Day the small dance at Mena
            House was well attended, which was surpris-
            ing, considering that many similar functions
            took place that night. We noticed among
            the visitors Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. Ludlow,
            Major And Mrs. Delavoy, Miss Curry, Mrs.
            John Diamaut, Mr. and Mrs. John Ross,
            Miss Berry, Miss Leigh, Mr. and Mrs. C. W.
            Johnstone, Miss Wetherhill, Mr. Larchester

            The meeting of the Railway Institute and D
            Co. K. R. R. Corps, at Boulac, was witnessed
            by a good number of spectators. The visitors
            were the first to score, but a few minutes later
            the home team equalised. When well into the
            first half, Smith scored the home team’s second
            goal after a brilliant piece of individual
            play. Up to the interval play was very fast
            and the game was fairly open. The second
            half was a trifle tame, for both sets or for-
            wards lacked combination, and the and came
            without any further scoring. The home de-
            fence had plenty of work to do in the last
            part of the game, especially the custodian,
            Mr. R. Appleby, who was in fine form between
            the posts.</div>
