                        <p>Berths can be definitely engaged as if the voyage were commencing at Port Said. Plans

                        <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are intended to leave
                            Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will
                            meet the train to convey passengers to the ship.</p>
                        <p>The Brindlei Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails arrive

                            cent on returning within 12 months. </p>
                        <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about twice a fortnight
                            of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at Malta or Marseilles.</p>

                        to be fine and clear andwarm. The barometee is rising and no
                        rain is to be expected if the wind continues in the same direction.</p>

                    <head>The New Railway</head>
                    <p>We give elsewhere some details as to the
                        invitations to be issued in connection with the
                        opening of the Nile-Red Sea line, which is to
                        be as important a ceremony as was that on the
                        opening of the Assouan Dam. The idea of a
                        railway dates back to the days of Ismail Pasha,
                        who, when Khedive realised that if Egypt was
                        to maintain its hold on the Sudan trade
                        down the Nile, he was led to abandon its
                        natural outler by the route from Suakin to
                        Berber, and determinedto make a railway
                        along the Nile from Wady Halfa, past the
                        cataracts. On this project, which collapsed in
                        1877, half a million was spent on building
                        fifty miles of rails, which ended en fair, or,
                        rather, in the desert. The Suskin-Berber line
                        was later on strongly advocated by General
                        Gordon, and in 1885, after Gordon's death,
                        the Ministry of Mr. Gladstone actually
                        authorised the construction of a railway to the
                        Nile from Suakin, and a feeble start was made
                        in the building of the line. Then Mr. Gladstone
                        decided to abandon the Sudan; and the work
                        came to an end- at considerable cost to the
                        British taxpayer.When at length the Sudan
                        was reconquered by Lord Kitchener, a rail-
                        way, as all thw world knows, was built across
                        the desert from Wady Halfa to Khartoum,
                        and the dream of Ismail realised after a
                        quarter of a century. The Khartoum line was
                        built, however, for military purposes, and as
                        a commercial highway it has been well nigh
                        useless, for it is impossible to force trade
                        into an unnatural channel. No one has re-
                        cognised this more clearly than Lord Cromer,
                        and to his determination to give the Sudah
                        a chance of becoming self-supporting, to bring
                        prosperity (and therefore happiness) to its in-
                        habitants, we owe the building this line.</p>
                    <p>It is almost impossiblr to exaggerate the
                        important results expected to flow from the
                        opening of thisrailway. Lest it be thought
                        that our optimism hasno substantial founda-
                        tion, we will not go beyond the language used
                        by Lord Cromer on the subject. The line, it
                        must be observed, passes through no territory
                        capable of much development, save for the
                        few miles it follows the Atbara; it is but a
                        means to an end, a bridge over the waste of
                        desert which separates the Eastern Sudan from
                        the outer world.But it will be a bridge of sur-
                        passing importance. To mention one item, it
                        will immensely sheapen the cost of fuel (coal)
                        at Khartoum, and thus will permit commercial
                        developments impossible while, as at present,
                        coal costs at Khartoum some 4 a ton.
                        Again, it will render possible the construction
                        of subsidiary railways in the fertile regions of
                        the Sudan; a branch line to Kassala, and a 
                        railway from El Obeid to E. Dueim on the Nile
                        are already contemplated. The Kassala-line
                        will tap a region rich in cereals; that from El
                        Obeid will enable the gum arabic of Kordofan
                        to be put on the world's markets at a consider-
                        ably reduced price, while giving the merchants 
                        greater profit. Of more immediate importance
                        is the line now being built, from Abon Hamed
                        to the Dongola province; by this means it is
                        believed that Dongola will capture the trades in
                        cereals with Arabia. Besides all these things,
                        there is the probability- the great probability
                        -of the Sudan becoming a very large producer
                        of cotton.</p>
                    <p>It is a mistake to suppose, as is sometimes
                    done, that the new line will injure Egypt. It is
                    not a question of taking trade away from
                    Alexandria and transferring it to the Red Sea
                    ports. It is rather a question of creating a new
                    trade, which but for the railway could not
                    exist. It cannot be doubted that the construc-
                    tion of the Red Sea-Nile railway is a distinct
                    step in making the Sudan self-supporting. The
                    railway, in fact, should prove as beneficient for
                    the Sudan as the construction of the Assouan
                    dam has proved beneficent for Egypt.</p>

            <p>The sentences passed on the persons accused
            of taking part in the recent riot at Alexandria
            have furnished matter for comment in the

            <p>"Al Lewa" remarks:- “These being the
            sentences passed on the natives who were
            present in the square during the disturbance,
            without having any cognisance of the circum-
            stances, we await with interest the sen-
            tences which the Hellenic Consular Court at
            Alexandria will pass on the Greeks who were
            the originators of the incident. When those

            further remarks to make.</p>

            <p>Our readers (says "Al Moayad”) will notice
            that the 71 natives who were accused of taking
            part in the disturbance in the Custom house
            quarter of Alexandria have been much more
            severity punished than the 104 persons who
            were implicated in the riot in Mohamed Aly
            square, where the disturbances originated and
            the enormous mob assembled. The former
            were far from the “scene of the disturbance, and
            29 of them were acquitted because they were
            arrested without any reason. However, nine-
            tenths of the rest (42) have been unjustly
            sentenced.</p></div>

            and last week one of them, fired at her
            "durrat,” causing her death in a room where
            she was taking a bath. The markaz authorities
            have opened an enquiry into the circumstances
            of the crime. The murderess says that the fatal
            shot was accidentally fired, but the enquiry
            showed that the murder Was deliberately
            committed.</p>

            <p>From the late "Notre Oncle."
            The eminent French critic Sarcy, universally
            admired for his infallible good sense, cuse gave
            the following valuable testimonial: "The best
            and safest way of learning a living language is
            to speak it with some one who cannot or dare
            not speak a word of the other's tongue." On
            this fixed basis Mr. Berlitz drew up a whole
            programme of lessons which rapidly leads the
            pupil to a knowledge of the idiom which he
            wishes to learn." These principles are applied
            at 26, Rue de l’Eglise Copte Alexandria, and

            <head>APPEAL FOR CHURCH MEMORIAL.</head>

            <p>At the Church of Sr. John Westminster, a
            sermon was preached on Sunday week by
            Bishop T. E. Wilkinson in aid of the proposed
            Bishopric for Khartoum as a "Church Memorial
            to General Gordon.” Bishop Wilkinson, who
            takes the oversight of the Anglican congrega-
            tions in Northern and Central Europe for the
            Bishop of London, has for some time past been
            endeavouring to raise funds to provide an en-
            dowment for a bishopric at Khartoum in
            memory of General Gordon, and with a view
            to the extension of missionary operations in
            the Valley of the Nile. Bishop Blyth, of
            Jerusalem, in commending the scheme, wrote :
            "I hope our scheme will give a chain of bishop-
            rics along the Nile to the Great Lakes, and
            so onward to where we shall meet the Central
            African and South African diocesses. This
            would be the same scheme from a Church point
            of view which the Government has Imperially
            -Cairo to Capetown.” It may be as well to
            explain that the last sentence has reference
            to the late, not the present, Government.
            Bishop Wilkinson based his address on the
            words from the Epistle of the day: “It is
            required of stewards that a man be found
            faithful," and in the course of his remarks
            pointed out that Great Britain had been
            placed by Providence in charge of enormous
            territories in Africa. It was a mighty steward-
            ship, and what were we doing for the present
            and future welfare of those regions. He was
            only going to speak of one section, the 2,500
            miles of the Valley of the Nile. The Church
            ought to have a chain of stations from Cairo
            to the Great Lakes. The natives were worth
            helping. Sir Samuel Baker, who had spent so
            many years in exploring that region, spoke
            very highly of their intelligence and faithful-
            ness. There were a few native Christians about
            the sources of the Nile, and some of them had
            been subjected to severe persecution and tor-
            ture. Baker said: “Khartoum is hell itself; the
            atrocities of this region are beyond anything
            I can describe.” Gordon himself said : “I would
            give my life for these poor people of the
            Sudan.” Neither the Church nor the country
            had recognised its debts to General Gordon. In
            his memory they ought to try and make Khar-
            toum a holy city, a centre of usefulness and
            light, from which civilisation and Christianity
            should go forth to the outermost parts of the
            Nile Valley.</p></div>

            of the members of the Coptic National Council
            which was held on Friday evening in Cairo.
            The Patriarch addressed the assembly, wish-

            <head>MACHINE GUNS FOR EGYPT.</head>

            <p>A test of the Rexer automatic machine gun
            ordered for the Egyptian Government took
            place on Tuesday week at the Runymede range.
            The Egyptian Government is taking about 50
            of these guns, and in the trials the cartridges
            used were loaded with the Nitrokol explosive
            which is a pyrocollodium powder similar
            to that adopted in Russia and now used in
            England. With the general details of the gun
            service men are tolerably familiar, and it is
            sufficient now to say that the power for work-
            ing the mechanism is obtained from the recoir,
            which, when the gun is fired, drives the barrel,
            together with the breech and the other moving
            part, some 2 in. backwards, this compressing a
            recoil spring behind the breech. After the force
            of the recoil is expended this spring expands
            and drives the barrel forward into the firing
            position. The recoil and return of the breech
            operate levers, which open the breech, eject
            the empty case, and insert a new cartridge in
            the chamber. No water jacket is required for
            this gun, which is cooled by air, and which
            weighs only 17 lb. The magazine holds 25
            cartridges, and can be discharged, by con-
            tinuous automatic firing, in three and a half
            seconds. Other tests at the trial showed that
            magazines could be replaced with rapidity,
            and 175 rounds were discharged in 70 seconds.
            The "scatter" of the bullets is not great, for
            when three magazines were fired at a target
            5 ft. square, at 200 yards, it was found that 70
            bullets out of the 75 were on the target.
            Previous experiments show that the "scatter"
            of the bullets was in the same proportion at
            the longer ranges. After firing it was found
            that although the steel barrel cover became
            much heated it was always possible to hold
            the gun by the lock, where the metal was
            quite cool.</p></div>

            <p>The only German line plying regularly be-
            tween Germany and Alexandria has been the
            German Levant Line, but at the end of this
            month a second line, the Atlas Steamship Line
            of Bremen, will begin to run steamers in such
            a way that they will run alternately with those
            of the German Levant Line. The region that
            will be served by the new line of steamships
            will be Greece, Asia Minor, the Black Sea,
            Syria, and Egypt. Both these steamship lines
            will carry goods from Hamburg or Bremen
            under through bills of lading to the Levantine
            ports, and also to the stations along the Anato-
            lian and Bagdad Railways. For the immediate
            future regular voyages are fixed for Malta,
            the Piraaus, Smyrna, Salonica, Dedeagatch,
            Constantinople, and Odessa, and also to Alex-
            andria and Beyrout. The Atlas Line owns
            seven steamers of from 2,800 to 3,500 tons
            capacity, and capable of steaming at twelve
            knows. For the present, according to the "Kol-
            nische Zeitung," cargo will be carried, with
            only a few passengers. The Atlas Line has
            branches in Constantinople and Cologne, and
            in both centres the enterprise is regarded as
            another visible sign that Germany means to
            capture the whole of the trade in the Near
            East.</p></div>

            <p>The increase in the number of advanced
            pupils in the free and Wakf kuttabs is a satis-
            factory proof of the increased desire for educa-
            tion and its advantages, and statistics will
            shortly be published showing the exact increase
            in their numbers for the last few years. That
            the new zeal for a practical education in no
            way impedes religion teaching, is proved by
            recent statistics given by Sheikh Sherif, which
            show that the number of pupils learning the
            whole of the Koran now amounts to 4,609.
            3,604 are at work on three-quarters, 4,301 on
            the half, and 6,465 on a quarter of the sacred
            book of Islam. The fear expressed by some
            Moslem Conservatives that the Koran might
            be neglected, despite the constitution of the
            kuttabs, is obviously unfounded.</p></div>

            Keneh, December 24.
            A meeting was held in the Keneh Markaz of
            the omdehs, merchants, and notables of the
            town, the sub-moudir, Mr. Haxell, of the
            Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Smith, of the
            Finance Ministry, and many other equally
            distinguished persons. The sur-moudir opened
            the proceedings by a speech explaining the
            object of the gathering and urging them to
            help the kuttabs and their masters, aa many
            benefits were to be derived from them.</p>

            <p>The Inspector of the kuttabs then deli-
            vered a speech on the uses of education, its
            effect upon civilisation, the benefits of new
            discoveries, and the necessity of spreading
            knowledge among Egyptians, and made an
            instructive comparison between the percentage
            of those who know how to read and write in
            Egypt and in Europe. He also recalled the
            Prophet's sayings regarding cleanliness, edu-
            cation, and religion. He closed his speech by
            insisting that the pedagogues should see to the
            cleanliness of their boys and class-rooms, and to
            the order of the curriculum, and urged on them
            to build np a new generation, imbued with ideas
            of order and organisation, fit to take a place
            worthy of Egypt's position in the present
            century.</p>

            <p>Afterwards the grants-in-aid were distribut-
            ed and the meeting dispersed, all agreeing in
            thanking the Ministry of Public Instruction
            for the care taken in giving these kuttabs
            such attention.</p></div>

            papers to send representatives to the official
            inauguration of the Nile-Red Sea Railway,
            which takes places on the 27th prox. Those
            who accept the invitation will travel by special
            steamer leaving Suez for Port Sudan on
            January 23, after the arrival of the afternoon
            train from Cairo. Eight members of the

            boat and will attend the ceremony.</p>

            <p>Last Saturday's small dance at the Savoy
            was a great success. As the management did
            not sent out any invitations, the dance was less
            crowded than usual, but the restaurant and
            the adjoining private dining rooms were quite
            full, and so was the table d'hôte room. There
            were also over one hundred suppers served
            after the dance. These suppers are very much

            <p>We also noticed in the restaurant: General

            Divine Peace of Pardon and Unity. The

            tion to contribute to sustain the fabric of the
            church, which is in urgent need of repair and
            renovation.</p>

            <p>The musical part of the service was directed
            by Mr. Serle Peacock and a highly efficient
            choir. The psalms and hymns were admirably
            sang. The anthem was by Barnby, “Chris-
            tians awake.” The decorations differed little
            from those which have been found effective in
            former years. The lines of the architecture
            were marked out with palms and the altar
            was bright with poinsettias.</p></div>

            ALL SAINT’S, RAMLEH.</head>

            <p>The services on Christmas Eve and on
            Christmas Day were attended by large congre-
            gations at both churches. The Rev. R. F.
            Rynd, B.A., conducted the services at All
            Saints’, and the chaplain and the Rev. A. H.
            Longley, B.A., the services at St. Mark’s.</p>

            <p>The anthem at St. Mark's “Angels, from
            the realms of Glory" (by the Rev. E Vine Hall,
            late Precentor of Worcester Cathedral), is a
            very simple and effective one, and was sung
            with precision and taste by an excellent choir.
            The soprano solo was taken by Mrs. Bayliss and
            the tenor solo by Mr. J. Purvis. Two melodious
            and beautiful carols by A. R. Gaul were
            also sung. The Magnificat Nuno Dimittis,
            Te Deum, and Jubilate were by Tours in F,
            and the communion office was by Woodward
            in E flat. The services were particularly
            hearty and congregational, Mr. S. O. Heston
            presided at the organ, and was responsible for
            the music as organist and choirmaster. The
            collections for the poor relief fund amounted
            to P.T. 1,409.5. To the Asile Rudolph P.T.
            195, and to the Wraxall Fund (per Mrs. Law-
            rence) P.T. 585 of the collection were given by
            the chaplain.</p>

            <p>Among these who sent flowers for St. Marks
            were Miss Batcheller, Mrs. Crafton, Mr. J. E.
            Cornish, Mr. K Ebell, Mr. E. W. P. Foster,
            Mrs. Dickson, Mrs. Steinschneider, Mrs. R.
            J. Moss and Mrs. P. W. Carver.</p>

            <p>The following were responsible for the deco-
            rating of the church : font, Misses Morrison
            and Talbot; altar vases, Mrs. Algernon Ward
            and Miss Christie; lectern, Mrs. Eyre; pulpit,
            Miss Dodd ; choir stalls, Mrs. E. J. Roberts.
            Not withstanding the heavy rains and the
            storms of the last few days, there were many
            flowers forthcoming, and the church pre-
            sented a bright and festive appearance. The
            communicants for the day numbered 114, which
            is an increase of 65 on the number who com-
            municated on Christmas Day, 1902.</p>

            <p>At All Saints’, Ramleh, the following sent
            foliage and flowers for the decorating of the
            church : Mmes. Alderson, Atkin, P. W. Carver,
            S. H. Carver, Moss, E. Moss, Parkinson, G.
            A. Williams, and Miss Wills and others. Those
            responsible for decorating the church were:
            font, Misses atkin and Moss; alter vases,
            Miss Wills; pulpit, Mrs. W. R. Williams;
            choir stalls, Misses V. Alderson and Harden;
            E. and W. windows, Misses Carver; N. and S.
            windows, Mmes. E. Moss and M. Birch. The de-
            corations looked extremely well.</p>

            <p>On Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day
            the anthem carol, “Angels, from the Realms
            of Glory" by A. R. Gaul, was sung ; also
            another Carol on Christmas Eve, “Come ye
            lofty" (E. Button). The singing was good
            and thoroughly hearty, and the choir was
            composed entirely of the regular members.
            Miss Alderson presided at the organ and
            helped greatly in making the musical part
            of the service so bright and congregational.</p>

            <p>The collections for the day amounted to
            P.T. 1,403.5. Of the P.T. 239.5 collected for the
            poor relief fund at the early celebrations, P.T.
            97.5 was given to the Asile Rudolph. The
            communicants for the day numbered 76,
            showing an increase of 82 on the number who
            communicated on Christmas Day 1902 ; the
            collection also this year was P.T. 390 more
            than in 1902.</p>

            <p>A comparison of numbers, etc, with those of
            three years ago is interesting as probably
            showing an increase in the number of residents
            in Alexandria and Ramleh who are members
            of the English Church.</p></div>

            <head>MANSOURAH AND TANTAH.</head>

            <p>At Mansoureh the festival began quite
            correctly on Christmas Eve and was well
            attended : some members of the Constantinia
            Company being present, bringing plentiful
            offerings from Bessandileh of roses and other
            flowers.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Carr, from Chawa, had sent in many
            evergreens; unfortunately she was too unwell
            herself to attend. There was holly from ladies
            in England, visitors of last year. The chaplain's
            wife being laid up with bronchitic asthma,
            Mrs Smith kindly prepared the church-room,
            cleaning brasses, etc., with the help of her
            daughter, and Mrs. Murdoch also decorated
            the room with great taste. These ladles also
            had practised the musical part of the service,
            which went heartily to the accompaniment on
            the organ by Miss Henderson, who has recent-
            ly volunteered her services.</p>

            <p>The 8 a.m. Holy Communion was well
            attended. It began with a carol, "On Christmas
            Morn,” and concluded with the hymn, “Bright
            the Vision," before the blessing.</p>

            <p>At Tentah, at 11 o’clock the service of
            Holy Communion commenced with a hymn.
            (No. 60). Two other ’Xmas hymns before
            and after the address helped much to brighten
            the service. The churchwarden, Mr. Wright,
            whose wife was unfortunately prevented by
            serious illness from attendance, with the aid
            of her sister, Miss Bailey, had made the
            churchroom festive with evergreens and roses.
            Mr. Lionel Ellis kindly took Mrs. Wright’s
            place at the organ for the occasion, and his
            remarkable talent thereat was much appre-
            ciated. The other warden, Mr. Wakeman Long,
            was in hospital, and some of the regular
            congregation had accepted invitations for
            Christmas away. The late illness of the
            chaplain seems also to account for the
            absence of others.</p></div>

<p>Yesterday morning thousands of strikers and
several hundred militia attacked the Kasan,

<p>Fighting ie mainly confined to narrow streets
in the commercial quarter of the town and

  <head>THIS BIRTHDAY.</head>
<head>BY BARONESS DE MALORTIE.</head>
<p>It is Thy Festival, most holy Babe,
And we would join in worship at the cave,
We who have waited for the coming night,
Watching the stars on Bethlehem's cool height
Gazing into immensity of space,
But no bright beings of celestial race
Parted the drifting clouds like coming dawn,
To hail the Saviour of the Virgin born.</p>

<p>We dream Thy Festival, and so would walk,
Beside tho Shepherds with their artless talk
Who tell us of the songs they heard above,
And that new message of eternal love.
It is a song we cannot understand,
Its speech is to us of another land,
Our eyes are holden, we but faintly see
The Saviour Christ upon the Virgin's knee.</p>

<p>It is Thy Festival, the breezes bear
Some Eastern fragrance through the midnight air
Wafted from that strange group beside the well,
Who could to others their new mystery tell,
Silent are they, until Old joyful sight,
Once more appears their star's effulgent light
Spreading in noiseless motion, wave on wave
Of opal glory, round a rugged cave.</p>


<p>On that dark hill for Him, to whom no place
Was offered by the tribe of Judah's race,
Yet this fair rock stood in Creation's plan
The cradle for the Son of God—as Man
Ere David’s first progenitor was born,
Or tendor Ruth had gleaned her sheaves of corn,
No hands had fashioned it—Save His alone,
Who made the hills, and set their walls of stone.</p>

<p>And here Angelic choirs in order came,
Saluting her the Blessed One by name,
Holy in purity all maids above—
Meek, tender, faithful, Mother of God's Love
Where He is Spirit came, as to His Home
Because “the fulness of the hour had come” ;
The Kings their offerings laid beneath His Feet,
And looked into His Eyes, so calm and sweet.</p>

<p>What they divined—Who mystic signs could read
We are not told, but there was joy indeed,
Where was the Crown, or Kingdom that they saw
The flowing out of life, for ever more.
Time beyond time in everlasting days.
Nations and worlds but glittering in His praise-
An ocean's depth of overflowing Grace
And its eternal Spring-the Saviour's Face?</p>

<p> O lovely Holiday, to us a Heaven,
When meditation to the mind is given,
It is Thy Festival -ah, make it ours !
Be dearer to us than our mirthful hours,
Let us believe the God Incarnate came
In form as Man to suffer for our shame.
So shall we hear the Anthem, of the Sky,
Glory to God—Glory to God on High !</p></div>

<head>FINANCIAL ADVISER’S REMARKS</head>

<p>An interesting chapter of the Note of the
Financial Adviser is devoted to the Egyptian
Railway Administration. Sir Vincent Corbett
remarks :—</p>

<p>The Railway expenditure in 1906 is estimat-
ed at a sum of L.E. 1,803,061 as against L.E.
L.E. 1,416,000 in 1905, or an increase of
L.E. 387,061 ; as, however, the estimated
receipts for the two years are L.E. 3,000,000
and L.E. 2,500,000 respectively, there is an
increase in the nett earnings of L.E. 112,939.</p>

<p>An endeavour has been made hitherto, to
limit the expenditure of the Railway to a
certain percentage of receipts (formerly to
45 % but latterly to some 52 % to 54 %); but,
as it is obviously in the interest of the public
that the largest possible nett earnings should
be realised and the largest possible volume of
traffic-carried, so long as no excessive capital
expenditure is necessitated, without reference
to an arificial proportion between earnings
and expenditure, it will be our policy in future
to spend as much as may be necessary to
obtain the best return; and, in order to estimate
more accurately the real profit from the Rail-
ways, it is proposed as soon as possible to
establish a Capital Account.</p>

<p>At the present moment, the Railways of
Egypt are in a transition state. For more or
less than twenty years past they have been
treated sharply as a money-making machine to
satisfy tbe exigencies of the foreign bond-
holders. If latterly a somewhat more liberal
policy was adopted, it was not possible under
the vexations restrictions of the Caisse de la
Dette to attempt to make up the ground that
had been lost; it was as much as the adminis-
tration could do to keep things going.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Railways were last
year transferred to Egyptian management, the
Government found itself face to face with a
problem of the most serious kind. For twenty
years the Railways had practically stood still
while traffic had increased by leaps and bounds,
the permanent way was in a state of indifferent
repair, the number of passenger waggons
and trucks entirely inadequate, and the per-
sonnel, taken as a whole, anything but up to
date. Under these circumstances, the first act
of the Ministry of Finance on obtaining its
financial liberty was to set aside a sum of L.E.
3,000,000 for the improvement of the State
Railways, and, the day that the last of the
Great Powers signified its assent to the Anglo-
French Convention, to authorise the President
of the Railway Administration to draw on that
sum to any amount for the purchase of rolling
stock.</p>

<p>A Commission of British experts, under the
presidency of Lord Farrer, visited Egypt in
December 1904, and drew up a report which has
formed the basis of all subsequent measures
of reform. In November 1905 the old Inter-
national Administration was abolished by Khe-
divial General. The supreme control of the
Railways is in the hands of a Board consisting
of the Prime Minister, the Financial Adviser,
and the Adviser to the Ministry of Public
Works and such other members as the Council
of Ministers may on the advice of the above
think proper to appoint. On its advice the
General Manager is appointed or retired ; it
must be consulted with reference to the appoint-
ment and dismissal of officials above a certain
rank, in all matters of railway extension, and
in the granting of contracts beyond a given
sum; further it may call for reports or informa-
tion on any subject it pleases, and issue
directions to the General Manager. But its
powers, comprehensive though they be, are not
intended to be used in diminunion of the respon-
sibility of the General Manager. In matters of
policy, the Board may, and must, be the ulti-
mate authority, but the techical work of
whatever kind, is in the hands of the former,
as the effective and responsible Head of the
State Railway Administration.</p>

<p>To supplement the work of Lord Farrer's
Commission, Sir Charles Scotter, the well-
known Chairman of the London and South
Western Railway, has come to Egypt to inspect
the work already done, and give the Govern-
ment the benefit of his valuable experience.</p>

<p>During the last year, thanks to the unre-
mitting energy of Major Le Breton, who has
been good enough to put his Indian experience
at the service of the Egyptian Government, the
Accounts and Audit departments of the State
Railways have been brought into thorough
order, and can now, it is confidently believed,
compare not unfavorably with similar depart-
ments elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Egyptian travelling and commercial
public, the Egyptian press, and the passing
tourist are all ready to gibe at the short-
comings of the State Railways. It is probable
that they will do so for some time longer. An
Administration which, through no fault of its
own, bound as it was by international shack-
les, has remanied practically stationary for 20
years, while the wealth and commerce of the
country advanced with phenomenal rapidity,
cannot make up for lost time by lavish ex-
penditure in one or two or five years. Rolling
stock can indeed be purchased though not in
unlimited quantities and at a moment's notice;
but lines cannot be doubled, nor sheds and
stations created where land has to be expro-
priated without long delay and often enor-
mous expense. New quays are wanted at Alex-
andria; public accommodation is required
here, there, and everywhere; “necks of bottles"
must be widened, but all this cannot be done
in a day. Practically unlimited credits have
been opened for all these objects, but those
who are the guardians of the public purse have
duties towards the fellah taxpayer as well as
towards the first class traveler or alien
menchant prince ; works must be put up to
tender, expropriation must be made at the
cheapest rate, and even then, it takes time to
create docks and sidings and warehouses. They
cannot be purchased ready made.</p></div>

<head>CITY MERCHANTS CHARGED.</head>

<p>At the Mansion House on Friday week, before
the Lord Mayor, Stewart Dixion Stubbs Ross, 38
general merchant, 18 Thicket-road, Anerley,
and George Bertram Ross, 35, of the same
address, general merchant, brothers, were charg-
ed with conspiring by false pretences to acquire
moneys and securities of such persons as should
become shareholders in the Anglo-Egyptian
Automatic Trading Company (Limited), and
obtaining, on April 1, 1905, a cheque for £525
17s 6d from Mr. J.G. Prentice. S. D. S. Ross
was further charged with obtaining by false
pretences, on June 16, 1903, from Mr. John E.
Champneyala a cheque for £648 7s 6d.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Rooke Ley, barrister, appeared for
the Director of Public Persecutions, and Mr.
H. Biron, barrister, defended.</p>

<p>Only formal evidence of arrest was taken,
and the information on which the warrant was
granted was not read in court.</p>

<p>Detective-inspector Murphy said just before
noon on the previous day he saw Stewart Ross
at his residence, and asked him to accompany
him to the police offices, Old Jewry. On the
way accused said, "If my brother George is
wanted he will surrender.” When the warrant
was read to him at the Old Jewry he said, “I
am quite innocent of fraud of any description,
or any misrepresentation. No two brothers
have worked harder or more honorably than
we did in the interests of the shareholders.
We ourselves nave lost a lot of money.” About
one o’clock George Ross surrendered at the
Old Jewry, and when the warrant was read
over to him, said “Thank you."</p>

<p>Accused were recommended on bill, two sureties
in £500 of one in £1,000 each.</p></div>

<div type= "item"><head>EGYPTIAN MINING DEPARTMENT</head>
<p>A mining station for the Department of
Mines is now in process of construction at
Edfou. The Department’s expenditure for the
coming year is estimated at L.E. 8,692, of
which L.E. 4,662 is for salaries, and the re-
mainder for well-sinking, communications, etc.,
etc. Special credits amounting to L.E. 1,500
have been opened for the completion of the
Edfou Station and provision for motor trans-
port.</p>
<p>The Department has been formed for the
purpose of issuing mining leases and licenses,
and generally controlling tha mineral industry
within the country. The extent of the regions
in which ancient mining centres have been
found is such as to induce the expenditure of
large sums of money within the next few years
for further exploration and development work,
most of which money will be derived from
sources outside the country and spent in it. The
department has been placed under the charge
of an Inspector-General, who will be assisted
in his duties by other inspectors and a special
staff of desert polioe operating locally from
Edfou.</p></div>

<div type= "item"><head>DISAFFECTED EGYPTIANS</head>
<head>THE WANT OF REFORMS.</head>

<p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
<p>Sir,—I read with interest your leading
article headed “The Capitulations," in your
issue of 18th inst, in which you attribute the
disaffection among the Egyptian population to
the difference in the treatment of European
and native criminals. Whether the transference
of jurisdiction over European residents in this
country from the Consular to the Native
Courts would be a blessing is open to question,
and is not a matter that I am going to discuss.</p>

<p>Personally I am convinced that there is
undoubtedly discontent among the natives
with the present state of things, and what is
even worse, the discontent is growing. If,
therefore, the recent disturbances have done
nothing else but to draw the attention of the
authorities to that discontent, they may be
said to be blessings in disguise.</p>

<p>The fact is that in spite of the much
vaunted prosperity of the country so lucidly
talked about in Lord Cromer’s reports, the
natives of the poor class see that while the
rich classes, both Europeans and native, are
undoubtedly, going ahead, their own condition
is certainly not improving. The Finance Mi-
nistry is the only department that may be
said to study the interests of the poor, by
systematically abolishing onerous taxes when-
ever practicable. The other Departments of
the Commonwealth, like Gallic of old, “care
for none of these things.” It would, however,
do good to these officials to visit some of the
houses of the poor natives. He would find that
numbers of them live in places that many of
us would not use for stabling horses. Many of
the native dwellings are merely wooden
shanties, with no floors, and with the recent
heavy rains the ground becomes a quagmire.
However on this, the man, wife and children
are obliged to lie down to sleep, with the rain
all the while coming on them through the roof.
At one time, empty flour bags could be got
cheaply enough and were largely need by the
natives as mats to lie on and rags to cover
themselves up with, but this year, these bags
are high up in price and beyond the means of
the poor. Is it not the duty of a Government
to provide for the homing of the poor? The
London County Council have admitted this
responsibility, thanks to the votes of the Pro-
gressives. When will the Egyptian Govern-
ment imitate their example ? Cannot the
Wakf Administration, who I understand have
funds lying idle, be induced to undertake this
work, and so secure a small return for their
outlays, while at the same time fulfilling a
sacred Mohamedan duty?</p>

<p>The wages of the Egyptian labourer and
fellah are very low, hardly enough to en-
able them to keep body, and soul together, and
there is no possible chance of them ever being
able to save anything for old age. This can
be borne out by the returns of the Post Office
Savings Banks. What provision will the Go-
vernment make for old age pensions to these
unfortunate creatures, most of whom have
rendered several years military service on com-
pulsion? Surely the State should be for the
individual and not the individual for the
State.</p>

<p>Again, by reason of far less favorable con-
ditions of living, the native is more subject to
disease than the average European. The death
rate also is higher among the former than
among the latter. One would think that these
telling facts would be known to the Govern-
ment and that District Medical Officers, both
male and female, would be appointed by the
State to minister to the suffering poor, also
that public dispensaries would be opened in
poor quarters, where the natives might obtain
drugs free. Such a system would operate
educationally on the natives, who would soon
learn the need of cleanliness, so highly enjoin-
ed by the Koranic law. I am told on good
authority that hundreds of natives die with-
out medical attendance, and that the Sanitary
doctor is obliged in these cases to formulate
a certificate of death as best he can, at it is
clearly out of the question to perform a post-
mortem examination in the dead man’s room,
and to forcibly take the body to the mortuary
at the hospital for autopsy would certainly
produce a riot. It is obvious that under these
circumstances it is impossible for the Sanitary
Department to issue reliable statistics of mor-
tality, and that it is very possible many crimes
of poisoning remain undiscovered.</p>

<p>There are many other serial questions that
ought at once to be tackled, but time forbids
me to go into more details. The education
question is too vast a one for me to raise, though,
undoubtedly some country schools should be
established for the fellsheen aod their children,
both male and female. We should not then
have had to deplore the event in regard to
the American missionaries, who by the way,
I must say to their credit, have done good
educational work in this country. The police
and the coast guards, also the children in the
Government schools, should at once be instruct-
ed in rendering first aid to the injured.</p>

<p>It may be urged that it is difficult for a
highly centralised Government like that of
Egypt to deal with these matters. That would
be an argument for the adoption of municipal,
district, and provincial councils with powers
to attend to these matters. But in that case,
I hope the Government would not limit the
voting as in Alexandria to merchants, im-
porters and exporters. What would be the
present condition of London and where would
be the progressives of the London County
Council, if the electors were only members of
the above-named classes. To do solid work
for the people, it is necessary to have a wide
suffrage.</p>

<p>If in lieu of seeking for more repressive
powers over a hardworking, industrious, in-
telligent and generally well-behaved section
of the population, as the European or foreign
element is, the authorities were to divert
their attention to the wants of the poor,
we might never have had to lament the
recent disturbances, we should do away with
all disaffection among the natives, and the
Government would have deserved well of the
people and of posterity—Yours truly
J. Amigo.

<div type= "item"><head>JUSTICE IN EGYPT.</head>
<head>A NATIVE COURT INCIDENT.</head>

<p>To this Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>

<p>Sir,—A few days since you gave us an excel-
lent article on "The Capitulation." I was
almost persuaded to think that you were right
but not quite.</p>

<p>About three weeks ago I was reminded by a
little incident which I will endeavour to relate
in a few words, that native justice in Egypt
has still something to learn. I sent an Arab
servant to a native part of the town on an
errand. While there he was attacked by two of
his co religionists, and so badly beaten that I
sent him to a doctor, who made a written
report that the map required ten days' medical
treatment. The police acted very well in the
matter and promptly arrested the two offen-
ders, who were with my servant examined by
the Parquet, and in due time, or at all events
in about a fortnight, the matter was brought
before a summary judge, who very rightly
condemned the principal aggressor to prison for
a fortnight and his assistant to a fine of L.E.
10. Probably the master is still grinning at the
idea of having done better than the sub. ’Had
the matter ended here, there would have been
nothing to complain about, bnt unfortunately
the judge did not seem to think that he had
done enough, so he imposed on my man a fine
of L.E. 1 or a fortnight’s imprisonment; against
the advice of his friends, my man rather
rashly paid the L.E. 1 instead of going to pri-
son. Now he and all his family say they are
ruined, so that for mere pity I am obliged to
pay him back the L.E. 1, plus the chemist's
and the doctor's bill, so that this little errand
on which I sent my innocent servant costs me
nearly £4. I am told that there is no appeal,
but am also told that I may be comforted
with the assurance that the judgment was
“motivé," because while he was being held by
No. 1 he struck No. 2, who was at that time
doing his best to smash my man’s head, in
which attempt he appeared to me to have had
a reasonable amount of success. Does not the
Native Code admit any sort of legitimate
defence ? If my man had submitted tamely,
there is a great probability that he would have
been killed.</p>

<p>I understand that the emblem of justice is
generally represented by a person holding
scales ; if that emblem still holds good in the
Egyptian Native Courts, I beg to ask, through
the medium of your columns, that someone
should be appointed to give a few lessons on
their use to those who are entrusted to handle
them.</p>

<p>Is this the sort of justice into whose hands
we are supposed to fall, if, as you suggest in
your article, we give up the "Capitulations,"
because if so I for one wish to say:- Let us
bide a-wee, before we swop horses, I re-
main, etc.,

<head>TRIBUNAL DE COMMERCE MIXTE</head>

<p>L’Affaire du "Cairo"</p>

<p>La tribunal Mixte de Commerce d’Alaxan-
dria vient de prononcer son jugement dans
l'affaire du “Cairo”.</p>

<p>En voici les principaux attendus.</p>

<p>Attendu que la Societe Generale de Navi-
gation Italieone Florio Rubattino ayant fait
abandon du navire et du fret, les demandeurs
ont conolu a la nomination du Sieur Prencipi
deja nomme tiers consiguataire du navire
“Cairo” par ordonnance du nrefere du 21 mars
1905, liquidateur judiciaire pour la repartition
amiable entre parties sauf a porter toute con-
testation devant ce tribunal; quils demandent
en meme temps la fixation du montant du
pejudice materiel et moral subi par suite du
nanfrage;</p>

<p>Attendu que la Societe Florio Rubattino
declare que par suite de l’abandon elle n’a
pas de conclusions a prendre du chef de la
liquidation des sommes reclamees a titre de
dommages-interets et qu'elle adhere-a la nomi-
nation du liquidateur judiciaire dans les
termes de la demande ; qu’il y a lieu de lui
donner acte de cette declaration.</p>

<p>Attendu que le Comire des assureurs mari-
time de Genes tout en contestant les dom-
mages moraux declare s’eu referer a justice
pour le reste ;</p>

<p>Attendu en ce qui concerne les dommages-
interets que les demandeurs font valoir le
prejudice materiel resultant de la perte d
leurs effets et le prejudice moral a eux cause
par les angoisses et souffrances eprouvees
pendant le naufrage; qu’en l’espece l-element
moral etant de nature imponderable et par
suits non susceptible d’etre apprecie en argent
le tribunal estime qu'il n’y a pas lieu de
prendre en consideration le pretendu prejudice
moral et se borne a l'evaluation du prejudice
materiel ;</p>

<p>Attendu que le serment “in litem" propose
par une partie des demandeurs n’est pas
admissible, un tel serment n’etant prevu par
auoun article du Code de Procedure ; que
les demandes paraissant pour la plupart etre
exagerees, le tribunal en tenant compte de
la situation respective des demandeurs dout
une partie formait une troupe d’artistes
dramatiques et les autres etaient passagers
de 3me classe, pour la majeure partie de
profession inconnue et apres avoir procede
a une reduction taut proportionnelle que
progressive a fixe ex sequo et bono les sommes
plus bas indiquees en estimant qu'elles cons-
tituaieut une auffisante reparation.</p>

<p>Par ces motifs:

Statuant publiquement et contradictoire-
ment, le Ministere Public entendu, ecartant
toutes conclusions plus amples ou contraires;
joint les affaires insorites au Role General sub
N' 3036 jusqu’a 3034, 3056, 3058, 5295 jusqu’a
5324 de la XXXeme annee et statuant par un
seal et meme jugement;</p>

<p>Donne acte aux Sieurs Edward L. Lawrence,
De Blauche L. Lawrence, De Vve Elizabeth C.
Whiting, Sieur von Alten, Dr Hugo Wernicke
de leur intervention ;</p>

<p>Donne acte a la Societe Generale de Na-
vigation Italienne Florio Rubattino qu’elle
n'a pas de conclusions a prendre sur la liqui-
dation des creances des demandeurs du chef de
la perte de leurs effets ou dommages moraux
et qu’elle adhere a la nomination d’un liquida-
teur dans les conditions de la demande;</p>

<p>Nomme sur accord des parties le Sieur A.
Prencipe liquidateur judiciaire pour la reparti-
tion du net produit du navire echoue “Cairo"
et du fret abandonne;</p>

<p>Liquide les creances des demandeurs et des
intervenants von Alten et Wernicke en les re-
duisant aux sommes suivantes... (suit une
liste complete et detaillee des demandeurs
avec le montant de leurs indemnites respec-
tives).</p>

<p>Dit que pour les sommes sus-enoncees les
sus-nommes seront admis a la repartition con-
fiee an liquidateur;</p>

<p>Renvoie led parties a faire compte devant
le liquidateur; dit que faute d’entente amiable
entre parties sur toute question relative a la
repartition notamment en ce qni concerne
la determination du fret abandonne, les frais
du sauvetage et les droits eventuels de
privilege ou de preference entre passagers
et chargeurs, les contestations seront portees
devant ce tribunal pour y etre statue ulte-
rieurement sur requete de la partie la plus
diligente.</p>

<p>Depens a la charge de la liquidation.</p>

<p>Le President

(Signe De Zoltan.

Ce jugement accorde a Ermete Novelli
une somme de 75000 francs et a Olga Giannini
une autre somme de 40000 francs. Le total
general des indemnites est d’environ 200,000
francs.</p></div>

<div><head>LES HABITATIONS ECONOMIQUES</head>

<p>On nous communique la traduction suivante
d'un article du Messagiere Egiziano :</p>

<p>C'est avec une reelle satisfaction et un ferme
espoir de reussite que le public de notre ville
a appris qua la Municipalite a pris en serieuse
consideration le projet des "habitations eco-
nomiques" presente par la Commission Inter-
nationale des Locataires, at a, seance tenante,
afin de mieux etudier, apprecier et resoudre
la question vitale des loyers, nomme un
Comite special compose de MM. Fenderl,
Mansour Bey Youssef, Zervudachi et Chataway
Bey.</p>

<p>Ce faisant, la Municipalite d’Alexandrie,
consciente des justes plaintss qui a’elevent
journellement de la blasse ouvriere-cette
derniere est celle, en effet, qui se ressant le
plus des augmentations tonjours croissantes
des loyers—vient d’accomplir, par sa louable
determination, une ceuvre hautement huma-
nitaire, qui lui vaudra non seulement la
reconnaissance de la population ouvriere de
la ville, mais encore la satisfaction d'avoir
soulage un nombre considerable de families
qui souvent sont obligees de se priver de
manger pour pouvoir arriver a payer leur
terme.</p>

<p>Nous vivona dans nn siflole ot le progrts
est a l’ordre du jour, et necessite pour l’homme
une juste recompense de ses fatigues. Il doit,
sans exiger le superflu, avoir le necessaire,
afin de demeurer sain et robuste, actif et
laborieux et par suite honnete et bon.</p>

<p>Il existe ici des personnes, qui ne manquent
ni de coeur ni d’intelligence, et qui n’etant
pas egoistes, out compris que le pays a le droit
d’evoluer vers le progres et la civilisation.</p>

<p>Les membres dont se compose le Comite
d’etude nomme parsla Commission sont plei-
nement a la hauteur de la mission qui leur a
ete confiee, et c'est-plains d’espoir dans leur
reussite que nous attendons avec impatience
le jour ou la villa entiere se fera un devoir de
remercier publiquement les personnes qui
auront participe a un tel relevement econo-
mique.</p>

<p>Vous, donc, Messieurs, qui avez ete choisis
pour resoudre une question sur et pour le bien
general, nos voeux les plus sinceres vous
accompagnent. Accomplissez votre haute mis-
siou de facon a ce qu’on puisse, dans la suite,
vons citer comme example de conseillers
honnetes, capables et philanthropiques.</p>

<p>Avant de terminer, permettez moi, a titre de
reconnaissance, de remercier chaudement cha-
que membre en particulier de la Commission
des Locataires. Sans etre rebutes par les
fatiques, les desillusions, affrontant toutes
especes de difficultes, et confiants dans leurs
bonnes actions et leur devoir ils ont su lutter
avec une energie indomptable, contre tous
ceux qui s’opposerent a leurs desseins, mon-
trant a cette classe ouvriere et laborieuse,
dont ils avaient assume la defense, qu’ils
etaient toujours la pour proteger ses interets
vitaux.</p>

<p>Sans a’attarder aux mesquines insinuations
qui ont ete faites a ce sujet, la louable deci-
sion de la Municipalite y a mis un terme
et c’est avec impatience que le public eu attend
le resultat.</p></div>

<head>THE RECENT PROCLAMATION.</head>
<head>THE SUDAN GOVERNMENTS ACTION.</head>

<p>A few days ago we published a proclamation,
issued by the Sudan Government, directing
that no vessel shall be allowed to pass Bor, on
the White Nile, without permit. It is stated
that the Congo Free State forces have for some
time past occupied part of the territory situat-
ed between the Congo and Nile water-hed and
the fifth parallel of north latitude, the owner
ship of which is disputed by the Sudan and
Congo Governments. Diplomacy having failed
to secure the withdrawal of tho Congolese
forces, the Sudan Government has decided to
close the Nile entirely to the Congo posts.
Therefore, until the matter has been decided
Government steamers will not call at any of
the Belgian posts with passengers, mails, or
goods. The question at issue is of considerable
importance and it will therefore be both of
interest and of value briefly to recall on what
grounds King Leopold occupies spy territory
at all in the Upper Nile Valley, and what are
the claims put forward by him to which the
British Government, representing tbo interests
of Egypt and the Sudan, finds itself unable to
assent.</p></div>

<div type= "item"><head>STRUGGLE FOR THE BAHREL GAZAI</head>
<p>To arrive at a right understanding of the
questions at issue, it is necessity to cast one’s
thoughts back for about a dozen years, to
the time when Great Britain, France and the
Congo State were all advancing claims to the
Bahrel Ghazal. King Leopold had already
taken steps to establish vested interests ih
the country, while France was gradually
extending her influenoe eastwards across the
continent for her Congo Colony. The British
Government was rather awkwardly situated.
From Egypt the road to the Upper Nile was
barred by the Khalifa, while access by the
East Coast route was little more feasible, no
Uganda railway having then been constructed.
Such was the position of affairs when the Earl
of Kimberley, as British Minister for Foreign
Affairs, conceived a subtle solution of the
problem. Let the Congo State recognise the
Upper Nile Valley as within the British sphere
of influences; then King Leopold might be
granted a lease of extensive territories, which
in the occupation of the Congo State would
interpose an effective barrier between French
ambitions and the Nile. For a time all seemed
to promise well for the execution of these
plans. On May 12, 1894, Sir Francis Plunkett,
the British Minister at Brussels, and M. van
Eetvelde, Secretary of State of the Interior
of the Independent State of the Congo, signed
at the Belgian capital an agreement in which
the Congo-Nile watershed was laid down as
the boundary of the Congo State to the north-
west of tbe Albert Nyanza. At the same
time, however, an extensive area lying between
the Nile and the Congo-Nile watershed was
leased to King Leopold by Great Britain.
This area was limited on the north by the
10th parallel of north latitude—so that Fa-
shoda was just included in the leased territory
—and on the west by the 25th meridian east
of Greenwich. It was divided into two parts
by the 30th meridian east of Greenwich. The
lease of the eastern of these two sections—that
is, of course, the section fronting on the White
Nile was to lapse on the death of King
Leopold ; but in the western and larger section
the lease was to continue so long as the
Congo territories, whether constituted as an
independent State or as a Belgian - Colony,
remained under the sovereignty of King
Leopold and King Leopold’s successors.</p></div>

<div type= "item">
  <head>AN ABORTIVE AGREEMENT.</head>
<p>No British Government, it need scarcely be
said, would to-day venture to conclude an agree-
ment of this nature with the Congo State; but
in 1894 it was still possible for the Earl of
Kimberley to write that the Government were
satisfied that "this portion of the British sphere
will be administered in a spirit in full accord-
ance with the requirements of civilisation and
ot the Acts of Berlin and Brussels." Naturally
the agreement contained no reference to Lord
Kimberley’s design, to let the forces of the
Congo State into the Bakzel Ghazal in order
to act as a check on French expansion. But it
is noteworthy that on the day the agreement
was signed Sir Francis Plunkett addressed to
M. van Eetvelde a despatch conveying an
assurance that facilities would be given for
recruiting men in British West Africa, "to
facilitate the prompt and complete occupation
by his Majesty King Leopold II. of the terri-
tories in the western basin of the Nile com-
prised in the lease." There was no misconcep-
tion, indeed, on the part of Frenchmen as to
the effect of the agreement. It is unnecessary
to enter into details. The scheme proved to be
utterly abortive. King Leopold had concluded
one agreement with the British Government;
he made no great bones about concluding with
the French Government another agreement
which rendered the first non-effective. Three-
months had only just elapsed when on August
14, 1894, King Leopold's duly accredited re-
presentatives formally renounced on his behalf,
in exchange for the recognition by France of
certain frontier claims elsewhere, all rights of
occupation in the Nile Vslley on side the
southern half of the particular section of the
territory leased by Great Britain, of which the
lease was to lapse on King Leopold’s death. It
is this comparatively restricted area, extending
north along the west bank of the Nile from
Lake Albert to 5 deg. 20 min. N. latitude which
is known as the Lado enclave.</p></div>
<div type= "item">
<head>BRITISH FREEDOM FROM OBLIGATION</head>
<p>It may he admitted that if Fiance had made
up her mind to try to gain control of the
Upper Nile, King Leopold would have been
placed in rather an awkward position had he
occupied the whole of the leased area. On the
other hand; if he decided that he had no
alternative but to yield to the representations
of the French Government and conclude the
agreement of August, 1894, then the British
Government must be held to be at liberty to
declare the privileges accorded to King
Leopold in the previous May to be cancelled.
No Congo State administration was established
in the Bahr el Ghazal to act as a buffer be-
tween the French and tho Nile; and it is a
matter of history that the advent of Major
Marchand at Fashoda brought the two Great
Powers of Western Europe to the verge of
war. Yet not only has the Congo State
continued to occupy the Lado enclave, but
King Leopold has even advanced claims to
lease hold rights over the territories which by
agreement with France he undertook not to
occupy.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that these claims should
find some appearance of support in a despatch
addressed by the late Marquis of Salisbury
during the Fashoda crisis to Sir Edmund
Monson, then British Ambassador at Paris.
In this dispatch Lord Salisbury wrote that
the arrangement concluded with the King of
the Belgians remained in full force, never
having been repudiated or annulled by Eng-
land. It is obvious, however, from what follows
in the despatch and from the time at which
it was written that Lord Salisbury’s object
was to emphasise the significance of the
agreement of May, 1894, "as an assertion of
her rights by England." There is no abandon-
ment of the position that Great Britain was
entitled to grant the lease, but nothing in the
despatch can weaken the equitable conclusion
that after what transpired following the signing
of the agreement, the British Government is at
liberty to treat the lease as null and void owing
to the failure of King Leopold to give the
consideration for which it was granted.</p></div>

however, there is reason to believe that the
British Government would not refuse to make
some allowance to King Leopold on the latter's
resignation of the position he has established
in the Lado enclave. Negotiations for with-
drawal of the Congo State forces have been in
progress for some years past, in the spring of
1903 a report was circulated that the terms of
the withdrawal were on the point of being
settled. The hopes thus held out have not,
however, been realised. What exactly is the
present position of affairs, either diplomatic-
ally or as regards the situation on the spot,
is involved in obscurity. It has been stated in
Cairo, as the reason for the action of the
Sudan Government in forbidding vessels to
pass Bor without a permit, that the Congo
State forces have for some time past occupied
part of the territory situated between the
Congo-Nile watershed and the tenth parallel of
North Latitude. A glance at the map will
show that the territory thus indicated includes
part not only of the Lado enclave bat also of
the other portion of the area originally leased
to King Leopold. Presumably, to judge from
the wording of the statement made in Cairo,
King Leopold, so far from acquiesing in the
demand for his withdrawal from the Lado
enclave, has overstepped the limits of that
territory, claiming the right to occupy not
only the enclave but the whole of the leased
area, and acting in defiance of the British
Government in pursuit of that claim.</p></div>

<div type= "item"><head>MODERN DEFENCE WORKS.</head>
<p>In this connection it is impossible to overlook
certain reports which may very well have influen-
ced the Sudanese authorities in deciding on the
step they have now taken. There is a suffi-
ciency of evidence that great activity has been
displayed in fortifying the land frontiers of the
Congo State, whether on the south, on the east,
or on the north. In the autumn of last year
it was repeatedly stated, in spite of official
denials, that a number of new forts—twenty
was mentioned as the actual number—were
on course of erection along the frontiers ; these,
it was reported, were being constructed in
accordance with the latest scientific principles,
and were being mounted with modern artillery.
Some surprise was excited by this informs-
tion, seeing that in 1885 the Congo State
had declared its perpetual neutrality and
had claimed tbe advantages guaranteed by
the Berlin Act, at the same time assuming
the duties which neutrality carries with it.
By Chapter III of the Berlin Act, to which
the declaration of neutrality referred, the sig-
natory Powers bound themselves to respect
the neutrality of the conventional basin of the
Congo so long as the Powers exercising the
rights of sovereignty or protectorate therein,
"using their option of proclaiming themselves
neutral, shall fulfill the duties which neutral-
ity requires.” It was further laid down that
in the event of a serious disagreement between
any of the signatory Powers originating on
the subject of, or in the limits of, the con-
ventional basin of the Congo, “these Powers
bind themselves before appealing to arms to
have recourse to the mediation of one or
more of the friendly Powers. In a similar case,
the same Powers reserve to themselves the
option of having recourse to arbitration.”</p></div>
<div type= "item">
<head>CASE FOR JUDICIOUS BUT FIRM
HANDLING.</head>
<p>The Nile Valley, however, is outside the
scope of the provisions of the Berlin Act, and
the Congo State’s declaration of neutrality
does not extend to the Lado enclave. Accord-
ing to one estimate that was put forward last
year the forces then in the enclave numbered
six thousand seasoned troops. This report was
discredited by the Congo State Administration
at Brussels, butt evidence at first hand of the
military activity of the State authorities was
furnished three or four years ago by M. Didier,
a member of the expedition under the Vicomte
du Bourg de Bozas which crossed Africa from
east to west. M. Didier gave particulars of the
strength of various Belgian posts on the Nile,
and stated that at Yei, a place on the Yei
tributary of the Nile, he found a garrison of
seven hundred and fifty men, officered by
Europeans, occupying a hexagonal-shaped fort
in which was mounted a battery of Norden-
faldt guns and Maxims. It is evident that
here are the elements of a serious situation,
especially when it is remembered that the
international position in Europe offers an
exceptional opportunity to the Sovereign of
the Congo State for the employment of those
subterranean methods of diplomacy of which
he is recognised as a past master by every
Chancellery in Europe.</p></div>

  <head>ARMY AND NAVY.</head>
<p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
<p>London, December 16.</p>
<p>Captain C. C. Maude, D.S.O., 2nd Battalion
Prince Albert's Somersetshire Light Infantry,
Devonport ; Lieutenant G. S. Symes, 1st
Battalion Hampshire Regiment, D.S.O, Ports-
mouth, and Lieutenant G. S. Wilson, 2nd
Battalion West India Regiment, Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>Captain Maude, who was latterly employed
with the Northern Nigeria Regiment, has been
nearly ten years in the army, and his decora-
tion was earned in the recent operations in
Northern Nigeria.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Symes has been five and a half
years in the Hampshires, and was latterly
with the 1st Battalion at Portsmouth. He
earned the D.S.O. in Somaliland.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilson received his first com-
mission in January, 1899, and has seen some
service in West Africa.</p>

<p>The last of the much criticised scout cruisers
— the Attentive - has just finished her speed
trials. This scout, which was built by the
worid-famed firm of Sir W. G. Armstrong,
Whitworth and Co., Elswick, proved herself
the speediest of her type, as she reeled off 26 1/2
knots per hour in the last hour of her trials,
whilst her mean speed for the eight hours was
25.88 knots. The Attentive measures 874 feet
in length, with a beam of 38 feet 3 inches and
a displacement of 2,620 tons, at a draught of
12 1/2m feet. She carries an armament of ten 12
pounders, eight 8-pounders, torpedo tubes, and
a crew of 268 all told.</p>

<p>The fire destroyers of the River class, which
were recently sent from the Mediterranean
Fleet to the China Station, have been ordered
home. As was pointed out at the time in these
notes, this class of destroyer, whilst possessing
many good qualities, particularly seaworthiness
in dirty weather, are too slow, their best speed
being 25 knots, and too bulky for their risky
work in war time. A single shot would sink
one of them, and the high freeboard presents a
good mark to a hostile gunner. They most
likely will find useful work as tenders in har-
bour and for training purposes.</p>

<p>It will not be the fault of Lord Roberts
if his reiterated admonitions fail to arouse the
population at large to a higher sense of pa-
triotic obligation than has existed latterly.
Even at the risk of being twitted with re
peating himself, the ex-Commander-in-Chief
took up the same ground in his discourse at
Newcastle-on-Tyne last week. With much of
what fell from him in connection with Army
re-organisation on a broad and comprehensive
plan, we are in entire ageement. We still
hold that all schoolboys between certain ages
should receive elementary military training,
to fit them for taking personal part in the
defence of the Empire in after life. The
veteran Field Marshal's call upon the nation
to cultivate a higher spirit in connection with
that obligation also coincides with what has
frequently appeared in your columns. It is
undeniable that "the flag” does, not com-
mand the same degree of popular homage
that is accorded to it by other nations.
While, too, our great Colonies enthusiasti-
cally celebrate Empire Day in one form or
another, the Motherland continues to regard
the innovation with more indifference than
liking. So far, then, we are completely at
one with Lord Roberts, and wish him all pos-
sible success in the campaign he has under-
taken. But if we may hint an apparently
hostile criticism, it is that although the
fundamental principles of his programme are
absolutely sound, they need to have their
practical application much more clearly defin-
ed. It is a popular conception, largely fed by
Little Englander denunciations, that Conscrip-
tion lies at the back of his scheme, and he may
be sure that his present allocation will narrowly
bs searched for fresh evidence. In any great
national emergency, whether insular or Impe-
rial, the State would have the right to apply
compulsury enlistment; that is, of course, a
truism. But that is a wholly different matter
to conscription in ordinary times as a basis of
military defence.</p></div>

  <head>THE WOMAN WHO FEELS WELL
EATS WELL.</head>

<head>THOSE WHO TAKE DR. WILLIAMS’
PINK PILLS BECOME WELL</head>

<p>Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
have cured of a violent form of indigestion
the yonng lady whose portrait is given below.—
Mlle. Hélène Coulloux, of 22, Rne Gondimet,
Limoges, France.</p>

<p>"For about eight-
een months,” she
states, "I suffered
intensely from weak
digestion. I could
not digest even the
lightest forms of
food, and I gradu-
ally lost strength.
My weakness be-
came so pronounced
that after the least
exertion I gasped
for breath. At last
I could eat practi-
cally nothing, I lost
Mlle Helene Coulloux,    weight, was nervous,
Cured by Dr. Williams'   and obtained little
Pink Pill.	             sleep. After trying
in vain all sorts of
remedies, and when in despair of being cured
I was advised by a friend to take Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. I did, and after two boxes I
was completely cured. I regained a good
colour, an excellent appetite, a perfect diges-
tion, and the strength that comes with new
blood."</p>
<p>All women, all young girls, desire tbe good
health that makes them attractive. If they
are not well they lose their charms, especially
if they suffer from bloodlessness or indigestion.
The anaemic sickly woman carries the traces
of suffering in her face. Her complexion is
sallow, her eyes sunken with dark circles,
while sick headaches and pain after any exer-
tion make her wrinkled and aged. The woman
who derives no benefit from food becomes
thin and loses her figure. Indigestion is one
of the principal causes of insomnia ; conse-
quently anaemic women who cannot digest
food lose strength daily, and at night obtain
little or no rest.</p>

<p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills cure ruined diges-
tions. They impart an appetite, fortify
the system and restore lost strength. Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills achieve this result by
their wonderful action on the blood, which
they enrich and renew. Under the influence
of this pure, rich blood the vital organs are
strengthened. In this way, and by their tonic
action on the nerves, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
have cured repeatedly anaemia, indigestion,
consumption, eczema, rheumatism, sciatica,
St Vitus' dance, paralysis, locomotor ataxy,
and ladies’ ailments. Sold by all dealers (but
take care that the full name, Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People, is on every pack-
age), or direct from Dr. Williams' Medicine
