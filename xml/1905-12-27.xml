            <head>NATIVE PRESS OPINION.</head>

            <p>The sentences passed on the persons accused
            of taking part in the recent riot at Alexandria
            have furnished matter for comment in the
            vernacular Press.</p>

            <p>"Al Lewa" remarks:- “These being the
            sentences passed on the natives who were
            present in the square during the disturbance,
            without having any cognisance of the circum-
            stances, we await with interest the sen-
            tences which the Hellenic Consular Court at
            Alexandria will pass on the Greeks who were
            the originators of the incident. When those
            sentences have been given, we shall have some
            further remarks to make.</p>

            <p>Our readers (says "Al Moayad”) will notice
            that the 71 natives who were accused of taking
            part in the disturbance in the Custom house
            quarter of Alexandria have been much more
            severity punished than the 104 persons who
            were implicated in the riot in Mohamed Aly
            square, where the disturbances originated and
            the enormous mob assembled. The former
            were far from the “scene of the disturbance, and
            29 of them were acquitted because they were
            arrested without any reason. However, nine-
            tenths of the rest (42) have been unjustly
            sentenced.</p></div>

            <p>Fatal Jealousy.
            Two wives of an Arab of Adlieh, Belb is
            Markaz, were on bad terms with each other,
            and last week one of them, fired at her
            "durrat,” causing her death in a room where
            she was taking a bath. The markaz authorities
            have opened an enquiry into the circumstances
            of the crime. The murderess says that the fatal
            shot was accidentally fired, but the enquiry
            showed that the murder Was deliberately
            committed.</p>

            <p>From the late "Notre Oncle."
            The eminent French critic Sarcy, universally
            admired for his infallible good sense, cuse gave
            the following valuable testimonial: "The best
            and safest way of learning a living language is
            to speak it with some one who cannot or dare
            not speak a word of the other's tongue." On
            this fixed basis Mr. Berlitz drew up a whole
            programme of lessons which rapidly leads the
            pupil to a knowledge of the idiom which he
            wishes to learn." These principles are applied
            at 26, Rue de l’Eglise Copte Alexandria, and
            1, Sharia Kamel, Cairo. [Advt]</p>

            There will be a grand ’Xmas Tree fête in aid
            of the funds of the Maternity Home in the

            All supporters of this deserving charity ought
            to attend. The Home is much in want of
            financial support at the present time, as it is
            necessary to build an establishment of its own,
            and a vigorous canvas is now being made
            by the ladies of the committee in aid of funds
            to purchase a site and build a home. Between
            £300 and £400 has been collected within the

            institution. To-morrow we will publish a list
            of the donations up to date.</p>

            <p>A. L. M. & D. S.
            The parish-room, Bulkeley, was filled to
            overflowing yesterday afternoon on the occasion
            of the repetition by Dr. Ruffer, C.M.G., of his
            interesting lecture on "The Desert of Sinai."
            As on the previous occasion, when it was given
            at St. Andrew's High School, the lecture was
            illustrated by a series of lantern slides, some
            of which are unique and of great interest. The
            lantern was ably manipulated by Mr. Frank
            Haselden, aided by Mr. Strick and Mr. W.R.B.
            Briscoe, M. A., who was in the chair, prefaced

            <head>BISHOPRIC FOR KHARTOUM.</head>

            <head>APPEAL FOR CHURCH MEMORIAL.</head>

            <p>At the Church of Sr. John Westminster, a
            sermon was preached on Sunday week by
            Bishop T. E. Wilkinson in aid of the proposed
            Bishopric for Khartoum as a "Church Memorial
            to General Gordon.” Bishop Wilkinson, who
            takes the oversight of the Anglican congrega-
            tions in Northern and Central Europe for the
            Bishop of London, has for some time past been
            endeavouring to raise funds to provide an en-
            dowment for a bishopric at Khartoum in
            memory of General Gordon, and with a view
            to the extension of missionary operations in
            the Valley of the Nile. Bishop Blyth, of
            Jerusalem, in commending the scheme, wrote :
            "I hope our scheme will give a chain of bishop-
            rics along the Nile to the Great Lakes, and
            so onward to where we shall meet the Central
            African and South African diocesses. This
            would be the same scheme from a Church point
            of view which the Government has Imperially
            -Cairo to Capetown.” It may be as well to
            explain that the last sentence has reference
            to the late, not the present, Government.
            Bishop Wilkinson based his address on the
            words from the Epistle of the day: “It is
            required of stewards that a man be found
            faithful," and in the course of his remarks
            pointed out that Great Britain had been
            placed by Providence in charge of enormous
            territories in Africa. It was a mighty steward-
            ship, and what were we doing for the present
            and future welfare of those regions. He was
            only going to speak of one section, the 2,500
            miles of the Valley of the Nile. The Church
            ought to have a chain of stations from Cairo
            to the Great Lakes. The natives were worth
            helping. Sir Samuel Baker, who had spent so
            many years in exploring that region, spoke
            very highly of their intelligence and faithful-
            ness. There were a few native Christians about
            the sources of the Nile, and some of them had
            been subjected to severe persecution and tor-
            ture. Baker said: “Khartoum is hell itself; the
            atrocities of this region are beyond anything
            I can describe.” Gordon himself said : “I would
            give my life for these poor people of the
            Sudan.” Neither the Church nor the country
            had recognised its debts to General Gordon. In
            his memory they ought to try and make Khar-
            toum a holy city, a centre of usefulness and
            light, from which civilisation and Christianity
            should go forth to the outermost parts of the
            Nile Valley.</p></div>

            <div type= "MACHINE GUNS FOR EGYPT">
            <head>MACHINE GUNS FOR EGYPT.</head>

            <p>A test of the Rexer automatic machine gun
            ordered for the Egyptian Government took
            place on Tuesday week at the Runymede range.
            The Egyptian Government is taking about 50
            of these guns, and in the trials the cartridges
            used were loaded with the Nitrokol explosive
            which is a pyrocollodium powder similar
            to that adopted in Russia and now used in
            England. With the general details of the gun
            service men are tolerably familiar, and it is
            sufficient now to say that the power for work-
            ing the mechanism is obtained from the recoir,
            which, when the gun is fired, drives the barrel,
            together with the breech and the other moving
            part, some 2 in. backwards, this compressing a
            recoil spring behind the breech. After the force
            of the recoil is expended this spring expands
            and drives the barrel forward into the firing
            position. The recoil and return of the breech
            operate levers, which open the breech, eject
            the empty case, and insert a new cartridge in
            the chamber. No water jacket is required for
            this gun, which is cooled by air, and which
            weighs only 17 lb. The magazine holds 25
            cartridges, and can be discharged, by con-
            tinuous automatic firing, in three and a half
            seconds. Other tests at the trial showed that
            magazines could be replaced with rapidity,
            and 175 rounds were discharged in 70 seconds.
            The "scatter" of the bullets is not great, for
            when three magazines were fired at a target
            5 ft. square, at 200 yards, it was found that 70
            bullets out of the 75 were on the target.
            Previous experiments show that the "scatter"
            of the bullets was in the same proportion at
            the longer ranges. After firing it was found
            that although the steel barrel cover became
            much heated it was always possible to hold
            the gun by the lock, where the metal was
            quite cool.</p></div>

            <p>The only German line plying regularly be-
            tween Germany and Alexandria has been the
            German Levant Line, but at the end of this
            month a second line, the Atlas Steamship Line
            of Bremen, will begin to run steamers in such
            a way that they will run alternately with those
            of the German Levant Line. The region that
            will be served by the new line of steamships
            will be Greece, Asia Minor, the Black Sea,
            Syria, and Egypt. Both these steamship lines
            will carry goods from Hamburg or Bremen
            under through bills of lading to the Levantine
            ports, and also to the stations along the Anato-
            lian and Bagdad Railways. For the immediate
            future regular voyages are fixed for Malta,
            the Piraaus, Smyrna, Salonica, Dedeagatch,
            Constantinople, and Odessa, and also to Alex-
            andria and Beyrout. The Atlas Line owns
            seven steamers of from 2,800 to 3,500 tons
            capacity, and capable of steaming at twelve
            knows. For the present, according to the "Kol-
            nische Zeitung," cargo will be carried, with
            only a few passengers. The Atlas Line has
            branches in Constantinople and Cologne, and
            in both centres the enterprise is regarded as
            another visible sign that Germany means to
            capture the whole of the trade in the Near
            East.</p></div>

            recent statistics given by Sheikh Sherif, which
            show that the number of pupils learning the
            whole of the Koran now amounts to 4,609.
            3,604 are at work on three-quarters, 4,301 on
            the half, and 6,465 on a quarter of the sacred
            book of Islam. The fear expressed by some
            Moslem Conservatives that the Koran might
            be neglected, despite the constitution of the
            kuttabs, is obviously unfounded.</p></div>

            <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)

            Keneh, December 24.
            A meeting was held in the Keneh Markaz of
            the omdehs, merchants, and notables of the
            town, the sub-moudir, Mr. Haxell, of the
            Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Smith, of the
            Finance Ministry, and many other equally
            distinguished persons. The sur-moudir opened
            the proceedings by a speech explaining the
            object of the gathering and urging them to
            help the kuttabs and their masters, aa many
            benefits were to be derived from them.</p>

            <p>The Inspector of the kuttabs then deli-
            vered a speech on the uses of education, its
            effect upon civilisation, the benefits of new
            discoveries, and the necessity of spreading
            knowledge among Egyptians, and made an
            instructive comparison between the percentage
            of those who know how to read and write in
            Egypt and in Europe. He also recalled the
            Prophet's sayings regarding cleanliness, edu-
            cation, and religion. He closed his speech by
            insisting that the pedagogues should see to the
            cleanliness of their boys and class-rooms, and to
            the order of the curriculum, and urged on them
            to build np a new generation, imbued with ideas
            of order and organisation, fit to take a place
            worthy of Egypt's position in the present
            century.</p>

            <p>Afterwards the grants-in-aid were distribut-
            ed and the meeting dispersed, all agreeing in
            thanking the Ministry of Public Instruction
            for the care taken in giving these kuttabs
            such attention.</p></div>

            <head>INVITATIONS TO LOCAL PRESS.</head>

            <p>Invitations have been issues by the Sudan
            Government to the principal Egyptian news-
            papers to send representatives to the official
            inauguration of the Nile-Red Sea Railway,
            which takes places on the 27th prox. Those
            who accept the invitation will travel by special
            steamer leaving Suez for Port Sudan on
            January 23, after the arrival of the afternoon
            train from Cairo. Eight members of the
            Legislative Council will travel by the same
            boat and will attend the ceremony.</p>

            <p>The importance of the ceremony has al-
            ready been insisted on in our columns. Lord
            Cromer will preside over the opening of a line
            which should make the Sudan financially inde-
            pendent of Egypt in a few years and will make
            it possible for the Anglo-Egyptian territory to
            throw its surplus products into the world's
            markets both economically and rapidly.</p></div>

            <p>A small dance will be given at Shepheard's
            Hotel on Sunday next (New Year’s Eve).</p>

            <p>On the occasion of the Christmas dinner
            the restaurant at Shepheard’s was crowded,
            and among many others we noticed: Mr.

            <head>SAVOY SMALL DANCE.</head>

            <p>Last Saturday's small dance at the Savoy
            was a great success. As the management did
            not sent out any invitations, the dance was less
            crowded than usual, but the restaurant and
            the adjoining private dining rooms were quite
            full, and so was the table d'hôte room. There
            were also over one hundred suppers served
            after the dance. These suppers are very much
            in favor this year after the Savoy small
            dances.</p>

            <p>Amongst the many dinner parties we notic-
            ed: Col. and Mm. Patterson’s party, the guests
            being Crookshank Pasha, Mr. and Mrs. Alston,
            Mr. and Mrs. George Royle, Miss Johnson,
            Mr. Constantinidis, and Mme Aghion. Mr. F. H.
            Russell had a party of 8, the Hon. F. G.
            Morgan had two guests, Mr. Curphey had four
            guests, and Mr. and Mrs. Stone had a party
            of 10.</p>

            <p>We also noticed in the restaurant: General
            and Mrs. Bullock, Mr. H. Humboldt, Sir
            Charles Metcalfe, the Marquis de Fioravanti, «
            Tueni Bey, Mr. Bowles, M. P., and party.

            <p>Next Saturday’s bill promises to be equally
            successful, as many tables have already been

            <head>ALL SAINTS’ CHURCH, CAIRO.</head>

            <p>The Christmas services at All Saints’
            Church, Cairo, were numerously attended.
            The Holy Communion was celebrated four
            times, at 6.30 a.m., at 7.30 a.m., at 8.30 a.m.,
            and after morning service. The number of
            communicants at the four celebrations was
            290. The services were conducted by the
            Very Rev. Dean Butcher, D D Rev. Thompson
            Borns, M. A., Rev. Rennie Maclnnes, M. A., Rev.
            A. C. Dicker, M.A., and Rev. Sheldon Woodle.</p>

            <p>The Dean took his text from Isaiah ix.6,
            "The Prince of Peace." He explained the
            difference between the peace of man, which is
            at best the peace of compromise, and the
            Divine Peace of Pardon and Unity. The
            sermon ended with an appeal to the congrega-
            tion to contribute to sustain the fabric of the
            church, which is in urgent need of repair and
            renovation.</p>

            <p>The musical part of the service was directed
            by Mr. Serle Peacock and a highly efficient
            choir. The psalms and hymns were admirably
            sang. The anthem was by Barnby, “Chris-
            tians awake.” The decorations differed little
            from those which have been found effective in
            former years. The lines of the architecture
            were marked out with palms and the altar
            was bright with poinsettias.</p></div>

            <head>ST. MARK’S, ALEXANDRIA, AND
            ALL SAINT’S, RAMLEH.</head>

            <p>The services on Christmas Eve and on
            Christmas Day were attended by large congre-
            gations at both churches. The Rev. R. F.
            Rynd, B.A., conducted the services at All
            Saints’, and the chaplain and the Rev. A. H.
            Longley, B.A., the services at St. Mark’s.</p>

            <p>The anthem at St. Mark's “Angels, from
            the realms of Glory" (by the Rev. E Vine Hall,
            late Precentor of Worcester Cathedral), is a
            very simple and effective one, and was sung
            with precision and taste by an excellent choir.
            The soprano solo was taken by Mrs. Bayliss and
            the tenor solo by Mr. J. Purvis. Two melodious
            and beautiful carols by A. R. Gaul were
            also sung. The Magnificat Nuno Dimittis,
            Te Deum, and Jubilate were by Tours in F,
            and the communion office was by Woodward
            in E flat. The services were particularly
            hearty and congregational, Mr. S. O. Heston
            presided at the organ, and was responsible for
            the music as organist and choirmaster. The
            collections for the poor relief fund amounted
            to P.T. 1,409.5. To the Asile Rudolph P.T.
            195, and to the Wraxall Fund (per Mrs. Law-
            rence) P.T. 585 of the collection were given by
            the chaplain.</p>

            <p>Among these who sent flowers for St. Marks
            were Miss Batcheller, Mrs. Crafton, Mr. J. E.
            Cornish, Mr. K Ebell, Mr. E. W. P. Foster,
            Mrs. Dickson, Mrs. Steinschneider, Mrs. R.
            J. Moss and Mrs. P. W. Carver.</p>

            <p>The following were responsible for the deco-
            rating of the church : font, Misses Morrison
            and Talbot; altar vases, Mrs. Algernon Ward
            and Miss Christie; lectern, Mrs. Eyre; pulpit,
            Miss Dodd ; choir stalls, Mrs. E. J. Roberts.
            Not withstanding the heavy rains and the
            storms of the last few days, there were many
            flowers forthcoming, and the church pre-
            sented a bright and festive appearance. The
            communicants for the day numbered 114, which
            is an increase of 65 on the number who com-
            municated on Christmas Day, 1902.</p>

            <p>At All Saints’, Ramleh, the following sent
            foliage and flowers for the decorating of the
            church : Mmes. Alderson, Atkin, P. W. Carver,
            S. H. Carver, Moss, E. Moss, Parkinson, G.
            A. Williams, and Miss Wills and others. Those
            responsible for decorating the church were:
            font, Misses atkin and Moss; alter vases,
            Miss Wills; pulpit, Mrs. W. R. Williams;
            choir stalls, Misses V. Alderson and Harden;
            E. and W. windows, Misses Carver; N. and S.
            windows, Mmes. E. Moss and M. Birch. The de-
            corations looked extremely well.</p>

            <p>On Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day
            the anthem carol, “Angels, from the Realms
            of Glory" by A. R. Gaul, was sung ; also
            another Carol on Christmas Eve, “Come ye
            lofty" (E. Button). The singing was good
            and thoroughly hearty, and the choir was
            composed entirely of the regular members.
            Miss Alderson presided at the organ and
            helped greatly in making the musical part
            of the service so bright and congregational.</p>

            <p>The collections for the day amounted to
            P.T. 1,403.5. Of the P.T. 239.5 collected for the
            poor relief fund at the early celebrations, P.T.
            97.5 was given to the Asile Rudolph. The
            communicants for the day numbered 76,
            showing an increase of 82 on the number who
            communicated on Christmas Day 1902 ; the
            collection also this year was P.T. 390 more
            than in 1902.</p>

            <p>A comparison of numbers, etc, with those of
            three years ago is interesting as probably
            showing an increase in the number of residents
            in Alexandria and Ramleh who are members
            of the English Church.</p></div>

            <head>MANSOURAH AND TANTAH.</head>

            <p>At Mansoureh the festival began quite
            correctly on Christmas Eve and was well
            attended : some members of the Constantinia
            Company being present, bringing plentiful
            offerings from Bessandileh of roses and other
            flowers.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Carr, from Chawa, had sent in many
            evergreens; unfortunately she was too unwell
            herself to attend. There was holly from ladies
            in England, visitors of last year. The chaplain's
            wife being laid up with bronchitic asthma,
            Mrs Smith kindly prepared the church-room,
            cleaning brasses, etc., with the help of her
            daughter, and Mrs. Murdoch also decorated
            the room with great taste. These ladles also
            had practised the musical part of the service,
            which went heartily to the accompaniment on
            the organ by Miss Henderson, who has recent-
            ly volunteered her services.</p>

            <p>The 8 a.m. Holy Communion was well
            attended. It began with a carol, "On Christmas
            Morn,” and concluded with the hymn, “Bright
            the Vision," before the blessing.</p>

            <p>At Tentah, at 11 o’clock the service of
            Holy Communion commenced with a hymn.
            (No. 60). Two other ’Xmas hymns before
            and after the address helped much to brighten
            the service. The churchwarden, Mr. Wright,
            whose wife was unfortunately prevented by
            serious illness from attendance, with the aid
            of her sister, Miss Bailey, had made the
            churchroom festive with evergreens and roses.
            Mr. Lionel Ellis kindly took Mrs. Wright’s
            place at the organ for the occasion, and his
            remarkable talent thereat was much appre-
            ciated. The other warden, Mr. Wakeman Long,
            was in hospital, and some of the regular
            congregation had accepted invitations for
            Christmas away. The late illness of the
            chaplain seems also to account for the
            absence of others.</p></div>
