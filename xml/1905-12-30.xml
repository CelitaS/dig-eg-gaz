                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged as if the voyage were commencing at Port Said. Plans
                      can be seen at the Offices of the Company's Agents. </p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are intended to leave
                      Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will
                      meet the train to convey passengers to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindlei Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails arrive
                      Passengers can go on board the evening before. </p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the special train
                      starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>

                      cent on returning within 12 months. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about twice a fortnight
                      of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for Australia
                      and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for Calcutta, fortnightly, and another

               <head>The Past Year</head>
               <p>It is ever the tendency of journalism to
               exaggerate and to attach an absurd importance
               to the ephemeral matters which come within
               its province. The overweening attribute of
               "speech-making" is applied to merely sensa-
               tional events, for the horizon of the comment-
               ator on daily occurrences must necessarily be
               limited in a great measure by having no stable
               basis for dealing with the patches of complicat-
               ed events which are brought day to day within
               hi ken, and the continuity of the world's
               development is obscured behind a mass of scare
               headlines. When therefore we have to review
               the salient points of the past year, it is very
               difficult to avoid unduly dwelling on what
               merely appears to loom large not because it is
               important but because it is recent, and through
               an excessive desire for picturesqueness, or sen-
               sationalism, as many would prefer to term it,
               to present a purely external view of the course
               of affairs. But we do not think there will be
               many among our readerswho will venture to
               deride us if we hazard the statement that the
               year, which ends to-morrow, will ever be reck-
               oned as one of the cardinal dates in modern
               history, and that 1905 will hold a permanent
               niche in Universal History as the starting
               point of events which will exert an incalculably
               important influence on the destinies of man-
               kind, for in the sequence of those world-histor-
               ical occurrences which link all nations together,
               and control their destinies, the historian of the
               future will assuredly give a place to that deci-
               sive naval battle which gave Japan a foremost
               position among the great Powers of the world,
               and will ever reckon 1905, which saw the
               beginnings of the Russian revolution, as im-
               portant a date as the year which saw the meet-
               ings of the States-General and the storming of
               the Bastille. All the other events of the year
               sink into utter insignificance before such
               colossal facts, whence the beginnings of new
               eras in the history both of Europe and of Asia
               will be dated.</p>
               <p>It is true that the revolution may even at
                 this hour be checked, but its advance will only
                 be stayed temporarily. It must be remembered
                 that there is probably no people which has such
                 a strong historic consciousness as the Russians.
                 There has been no great break in their deve-
                 lopment, no new object of their common effort.
                 They have not undergone the transformation
                 from an agricultural to an industrial civiliza-
                 tion, which puts much into the background,
                 and fills men's minds with new problems.
                 There has been to them no sudden extension of
                 boundaries. In their vast plains they always
                 knew the world was large, and that numbers
                 of their brethren might be added to their
                 family - brethren already like-minded with
                 themselves. Their past history is a long record
                 of struggles after union, which might make
                 them strong against barbarous invaders, of
                 untold sufferings endured with patient perse-
                 verance, of monotonous surrounding and con-
                 stant conflict with churlish nature, In all this
                 there are but two things that helped them-
                 their Church, which bound them together and
                 gave them courage to endure; their national
                 leaders, who trained them into strength, drove
                 back their foes, and welded them into a mighty
                 nation. Indeed, there were not two but one,
                 for Church and State are indissolubly connect-
                 ed. There was no ecclesiastical system with an
                 independent head whose claims might divide
                 their allegiance. They received their Christia-
                 ity from Byzantium, not from Rome. Their
                 ruler inherits the claims of no Holy Roman
                 Emperor crowned by a Pope, but is the repre-
                 sentative of the rulers born in the purple
                 chamber of the Bosphorus, and has never has
                 to divide his authority with a bishop whose
                 sway extended beyond his realm.</p>
               <p>When this perople, so strong in their historic
               consciousness, determine to break with their
               past, we may be sure that the emancipation of
               the Slavs will be thorough. But the emancipa-
               tion of Japan from Europe may even be more
               far-reaching in its results than the Russian revo-
               lution, and the sudden apparition of an Asiatic
               state continuously triumphant over a European
               adversary is enough to give the boldest pause.
               It is for the men of this generation, nay, of the
               last two centuries, and unexampled pheno-
               menon. Not for more than a hundred years
               has any single Asiatic state taken the ini-
               tiative of making an attaach upon a European
               foe and achieved any success thereby. An
               unbroken series of campaigns waged by
               Europeans against Asiatics has led to the
               establishment of the fixed idea in the Euro-
               pean mind that Asia was the natural heritage
               of Europe, that the Asiatic was the natural
               prey of the European, and that whenever
               Asiatic and European met in battle, the Euro-
               pean inevitably and always came off victor,
               although the odds agasint him were ten or
               twenty to one. Numbers did not count in 
               such contests. So it came to pass that, secure
               in the memory of innumerable victories in
               each of which this convenient working hypo-
               thesis was put to the test and verified by
               experiement of blood and fire, the European
               no more conceived of the possibility of a success-
               ful Asiatic revolt against his domination than
               the cowboys on the ranches conceive of the
               possibility of a revolt of the herds which they
               rule from the saddles of thie broncos. Now
               and then the European, like the cowboy, may
               get jammed in an ugly rush or unexpected
               stampede of his dumb-driven cattle. But it is
               only doe the moment, Europle always asserts
               herself and exacts terrible vengeance for her
               temporary discomfiture. So invariably has
               this been the rule that at this moment 70,000
               armed white men suffice to garrison the whole
               of Asia south of the Himalayas from the
               Khyber in the west to the forest frontier of
               Burmo-China, a vast and caried region inhab-
               ited by more than 300,000,000 of human
               beings. That gives over 4,000 Asiatics to
               each white soldier. Cattle on the Western
               ranches require a greater proportion of cowboys
               per 1,000 head. It is not necessary to conjure
               up dread imaginations as to another invasion
               of Europe. It is enough to realise that Asia
               is at present parcelled out among European
               Powers who exist solely bythe prestige of a
               success achieved by use of European weapons
               and by the despair engendered in the hearts
               of Asiatics by their long-continued defeat.
               The victories of Japan will change all this.
               Even if Japan does not Japanise China, she
               will establish her position as paramount sea
               power in those Eastern waters. Suppose that
               she confines herself to the sea, it is obvious
               even to the meanest understanding that the 
               whole political situation in Eastern waters,
               including Australia, will be revolutionised if
               she can maintain her present ascendancy.
               All islands will be held at her mercy- the
               Philippines, the Netherlands' East Indies,
               New Zealand, and Australia. The Japanese
               are 40,000,000 strong. Like the brave men
               of Marseilles, they know how to die. The
               story of their suicidal valous recalls the me-
               mories of the early days of Islam, and it is
               only rendered the more remarkable by the
               fact that their readiness to sacrifice their life
               does not appear to be sustained by any faith
               in the next. They have shown themselves
               to be quick to seize the advantaged offered
               by the weapons and the craft of the West.
               They have not studied in vain in the head-
               quarters staff of Germany or in the schools
               of the British navy. They are like other
               human beings, subject to the temptation of
               vanity, and they are not immune against the
               promptinfs of ambition. In the watchword,
               "Asia for the Asiatics," they have a weapon
               which may be used in a hundred centres at
               once, and which has already toused echoes
               beyond the Himalayas.</p></div>

              <p>Concert at Parish-Room, Bulkeley.
              A most successful and much appreciated con-
              cert was held last night in the Parish Room,
              Bulkeley. A large and representative audience
              listened with evident delight to the songs, the
              charming composition, "The Daisy Chain," and
              the instrumental music, which, for an amateur
              performance, was of a first class order. A full
              account of this concert will appear in our next
              issue.</p>

              <p>The New Organ for St. George's.
              Mr. John Davies, who erected the new
              organ for H.B.M.’s Garrison Church of St
              George, Mustapha Pasha, is deserving of the
              highest praise tor the able way in which he has
              put up the instrument. He is remaining a few
              days in Alexandria, and will be glad to give
              any information about the organs of the Posi-
              tive Organ Company, who make small organs,
              suitable for the drawing-room, as well as large
              ones for cathedrals and churches. Mr. Davies
              is going next week to Cairo, where his address
              will be at the Hotel du Nil.</p>

              (Gazette's Special Service.)
              Paris, Saturday Dec. 30.
              France is taking serious military precautions
              in view of any unexpected upshot to the
              Morocco Conference. The Kaiser's specific assu-
              rances are coupled with his declaration "To
              me alone does it belong to take a decision,”
              and this is not considered reassuring.</div>

              Mr. Yerkes, the regenerator of urban rail-

              ciers, has died at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel
              in New York. Death was due to complete
              physical collapse, brought on by overwork. He
              was a great connoisseur of art and had a
              superb palace of art treasures. The Press here
              is strong in its appreciation of his character.</div>

              Although day-to-day money in New York
              has gone np to 195 %, this is an entirely arti-

              <p>The Khedive attended Friday prayers at

              quently to Abdeen Palace, where he granted
              some audiences.</p>

              <p>While the Khedive was passing by Boulac-
              street yesterday morning, on his way to the
              mosque, a native woman made a scene by try-
              ing to present his Highness with a petition,
              shouting that she had been unjustly treated.
              She was quieted by a policeman.</p>

              <p>On Thursday, his Highness received General
              Faradfallah Khan, late Persian Diplomatic
              Agent at Cairo in audience, and yesterday re-
              ceived the German Commissioner of the Public
              Debt, Herr von Mohl, who had the honor to
              present his elder son, Mr. Hans von Mohl,

              <p>The complications in regard to the Grand
              Cadiship of Egypt appear to be increasing.
              For some unknown reason the family of the
              newly-appointed Grand Cadi suddenly left
              Alexandria for Constantinople on Wednesday,
              and their unexpected departure has given rise
              to considerable conjecture in native circles.</p>

              <p>It is considered doubtful whether the Cadi
              will return to Egypt.</p></div>

              <div><head>NEW CAIRO BOURSE.</head>
              <p>We understand that a financial group re-
              cently put forward a scheme for the construc-
              tion of a new Bourse at Cairo near the
              Hammam, on a site belonging to the Société
              Belge de l’Esbekieh, for which they had
              acquired an option, which expires on 1st
              January next. The scheme which was recently
              put forward met with great opposition on the
              part of most of the Cairo brokers, the majority
              of whom signed and approved another scheme
              to acquire a site for a new Bourse on land
              belonging to the Société Immobilière d’Egypte.</p>

              <p>We understand that there is no probability
              of any settlement being arrived at between
              the majority of the brokers and the supporters
              of the first proposal for some little time.</p></div>

              <div><head>LA DOGARESSA.</head>

              <head>M. SINADINO'S FIRST OPERA.</head>

              <head>YESTERDAY’S DRESS REHEARSAL</head>

              <p>It was yesterday our privilege to attend
              the dress rehearsal of La Dogaressa, a 3-act
              opera composed by M. N. Sinadino, with
              the book by M. V. Sinano, both such promi-
              nent members of Alexandrian society as to
              need no farther introduction on our part.
              This being as we understand, the composer’s
              first opera, it was scarcely to be expected that
              the result would be epoch-making and, while
              the work shows no mean talent for compilation,
              there is certainly a falling away on the side
              of creative genius. We have here a produc-
              tion replete with all the " outward and visible
              signs ” of grand opera, its church scene with
              the inevitable bells, its triumphal march, its
              interspersion of ballet, and its tragic finale;
              but all these ingredients are such as require
              to be scored with sweeping power and vivid
              contrast, and we venture to think that M.
              Sinadino does not altogether meet these require-
              ments. He has given us a wealth of dainty
              music, full of delicate nuances and pleasing
              romances, but it is clear that he has yet to
              learn how to make full use of his orchestra
              and how, in the heavier movements, to stimu-
              late the senses and impart his message in
              crisp and penetrating outbursts. He leads
              up very well to the more involved passages
              but has evident difficulty in sustaining the
              " ensemble. " This feature is especially no-
              ticeable in the first act, which to some degree
              may be said to want life and firmness of pur-
              pose ; it elicits some fair opportunities, inclu-
              ding a quartet of marked merit, and introduces
              the meeting and subsequent mutual passion of
              tho Dogaressa (Signa. Bellincioni) and Stellio,
              the Pisan Ambassador to Venice (Sig. J. Palet).</p>

              <p>M. Sinadino is strongly imbued with a
              Wagnerian tendency, and this influence is
              displayed particularly throughout Act II,
              which, while being unquestionably the best
              act of the opera, is far too redolent of Tann-
              hauser and Lohengrin to be set down as
              purely intuitive; the distant trumpets and
              the heralding of the Doge’s approach follow
              too closely the huntsmen’s horns (Act I, Sc. 2)
              and the clarions (Act III) in Tannhauser. Then
              the chorus of Venetians denouncing Stellio
              is very much on the lines of the climax of
              Act III of the same opera, even to the positions
              taken up by the performers. All this, however,
              in no way detracts from the many exceedingly
              good effects which M. Sinadino obtains in this
              second act. The curtain rises to a graceful
              minuet air, but with the appearance of the
              Dogaressa, who has a pretty solo, the music
              becomes more complex, with an undercurrent
              of strong motif. The entry of the Doge
              (Sig. Nicolay) is scored with much grandeur
              and expression and requires only to be original
              to be a true masterpiece. The scene, however,
              is much too protracted; the populace start
              to welcome their chiefs when he must be an
              unconscionable distance off. There follows
              then a sort of allegorical ballet, danced to
              a valse movement and savouring somewhat
              of Drury Lane. The act proceeds with the
              discovery of Stellio’s indiscretions and his
              consequent disgrace, and terminates with the
              flight of the Dogaressa after her lover.</p>

              <p>To Act III, there is a very beautiful over-
              ture, exquisitely rendered under Sig. Zuccani’s
              bâton. It is well orchestrated and proved one
              of the finest portions of the opera. The scene is
              now laid on the terrace of a Pallazzo by night
              and we find the Dogaressa awaiting Stellio,
              who arrives, rather tardily, and his retreat
              having eventually been discovered, he is stabbed
              by order of the Doge's men. To build a whole
              act on such meagre foundations must, not un-
              naturally, have taxed M. Sinadino to the utter-
              most and, although he makes good use of a very
              Wagnerian motif on the string instruments,
              there are several drags, which not all Signa.
              Bellineloni’s efforts, with the valuable aid of
              Sig. Palet, could eliminate. True, each of them
              have pleasing arias and the love duet rises to
              a high pitch of efficiency ; but on the whole
              (and this applies throughout the opera) the
              situations are too thin and few to justify the
              length of the action, and either big cuts or
              an elaboration of the plot are needed before
              the intrinsic value of the work is to be gauged.
              Signa Bellincioni, Sigri. Pallet and Nibolay,
              no less than Maestro Zuccani, spared no pains
              to give full effect to their several tasks, while
              Signa. Zeppilli and Sig. Pasquale were well
              cast for the respective roles of Bellarmo and
              Bianca, the confidante. The chorus have not (
              very lengthy work but what there was of it
              was hard and proved rather too much for
              them. We have no fault to find with the
              ballet, whose dancing was as graceful as their
              appearance. The mise-en-scene was very good,
              though rather too ambitious for the interior
              of St. Mark's (Act I) and the full expanse
              of the Piazzetta (Act II) looks palpably unreal
              when set in miniature on the Zizinia stage.</p>

              <p>There was a large number of guests at the
              rehearsal, and to judge by the warm approval
              they expressed, we may safely forecast a big
              success for to-night’s premiere.</p></div>

              <head>GREAT CHANGE IN CLIMATE.</head>
              <p>(From our Correspondent).
              Port Said, Thursday.
              Asked his opinion of Port Said, Mark Twain
              once remarked, "It is a good town—to be out
              of !" This appears to have been the opinion of
              many of the English residents during the
              celebration of ’Xmas. For those who did not
              leave the town for the gaieties of Cairo, there
              were the usual dinners, smoking concerts,
              dances, 'Xmas trees, and children’s parties.</p>

              <p>Services were held on 'Xmas morning at the
              various churches in the town. In the afternoon,
              the patients of the Lady Strangford Hospital
              were entertained by a conjuring performance
              and variety concert, at which many of the
              English residents were present.</p>

              <p>The football match, Mr. Chessman’s Eleven
              v. Maltese, ended in a draw, no goals being
              scored on either side.</p>

              <p>Following the spell of wet weather last week
              we have experienced what might be almost
              termed an English 'Xmas. Suez has had an
              even more unique experience in having snow
              on Mount Attaka. Old European residents in
              the Canal say that there has been a great
              change in the climate during the last twenty
              or thirty years. Passengers coming from India
              and China have been very much struck with
              the change in the temperature, and not a few
              have remarked that it is a foretaste of what
              they will find in England.</p></div>

              <p>(From our Correspondent.)
              Luxor, Thursday.</p>

              <p>Never before at this time of the year has
              Luxor been so fall of visitors.</p>

              <p>On Sunday, 24th inst., the English Church
              was well attended, and a most interesting
              sermon was preached by the Rev. Professor
              Sayce on 1 Cor. XIII. 9. "We know in part."
              There were forty communicants on Christmas
              Day at the two celebrations, and the preacher
              was the Rev. A. W. Gross, chaplain, and the
              offertory for the Luxor Hospital for Natives
              amounted to 11.13.10. Bishop Potter, of New
              York, celebrated on Dec. 27 (St. John’s Day).
              Over one hundred visitors sat down to the
              excellent fare provided at the Luxor Hotel on
              Christmas Day, and the "small dance" in the
              evening was well attended, and very enjoyable.</p>

              <p>The Sporting Club held its first Gymkhana
              of the season (in aid of the local charities)
              to-day, and 80 Europeans paid for admis-
              sion, while the natives from the town and
              neighbourhood came, as usual, in great force.
              The racing was excellent, and the committee
              are to be congratulated on the arrangements
              made for the amusement of guests and the
              benefit of several worthy objects. The local police, ,
              under the superintendence of the mrowan,
              preserved the usual good order on the course
              and its approaches.</p>

              <p>The following was the programme:-
              1	Bishareen Arab Race (Sack)

              <div><head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>

              <head>AFFAIR BEFORE TRIBUNAL.</head>

              <head>PROPOSAL REGARDING CREDITORS.</head>

              <p>The Sucreries case came up before the
              Chambre des Faillites of the Cairo Mixed Tri-
              bunal today. The Court was composed as
              follows; president, Judge Tuck; assessors, Judge
              Coghlan, Wierdels, Youssef Bey Aziz, and
              Moh. Bey Rassim. M. Musséri was European
              assessor and the Government was represented
              by Bairam Bey.</p>

              <p>Maitre Carton de Wiart informed the Tri-
              bunal that the following proposal had been
              accepted by the shareholders of the Sucreries:—</p>

              <p>"All Creditors, except mortgaged and pri-
              vileged creditors, are to get 80 per cent. of
              their claims, payable in debentures, bearing 5
              per cent interest from January. 1, 1910, and
              redeemable in 60 years at 25 per cent. premium.
              Up to January 1, 1910, the debenture holders
              are to receive a minimum of 2 per cent interest,
              guaranteed by sums deposited at the Banque
              de France.”</p>

              <p>Some discussion followed, the Court remark-
              ing that these proposals had not been formally
              put before it, and that the question of the
              railway, etc, had not bean touched.</p>

              <p>Maitre Carton de Wiart applied for a special
              meeting of creditors to deal with these points,
              and after further discussion the hearing was
              postponed for a week.</p></div>

              <div><head>REDUCTION IN POSTAL RATES.</head>

              <div><head>GHEZIREH PALACE HOTEL.</head>
              <p>This hotel gave its first small dance of the
              season on Thursday night, and despite all
              the disadvantages of cold and distance, many
              people braved the elements in order to be
              present. The Ghezireh Palace has a great re-
              putation for its dances and entertainments.
              Indeed, no better background oould be found
              for pretty frocks and uniforms than its gor-
              geous halls and salons. Many dinner parties
              had been arranged for Thursday, and covers
              for over a hundred and twenty people had
              been laid. Mr. Curphy was host to fourteen
              guesrs, including the Hon. F. Morgan, the
              Hon. and Mrs. C. James, Mr. and Mrs. Heller,
              Mrs. Bailey, Mr. and Mrs. Rom, Miss Begg, ’
              and Mr. Spooner. Col. Gordon was entertain-
              ing Lieut. Col. Watson and Mr. Carter Wilson
              among others, and at Sir Hugh Smiley’s
              table were Capt. and Mrs. Rome and Crook-
              shank Pasha. Lady Sampson had a party of
              eight, among whom were Major Davidson and
              other officers of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.
              Capt. Grant had a party of seven. Major
              and Mrs. Winn were entertaining friends, as
              also were Major Burnie, Mr. Horrold, Major
              Hessia, Mr. von Mohl, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bink-
              ley, Capt. Wynham, and Mr. and Mlle Saber-
              casseaux. Many other guests arrived after
              dinner, and by ten o’clock dancing was in
              full swing to the strains of most seductive
              music.</p>

              <p>Mrs. Rom was looking her best in white
              net, the skirt having a deep flounce of white
              satin, and a trimming in which silver tinsel
              played an important part. The foil net bodice
              terminated in a folded corselet and sash of
              white satin. Miss Begg, who always has the
              best of times, was wearing very pale pink
              with lace insertions run through with pink
              ribbon. Mrs. Rome, whose wedding made such a
              sensation in the autumn, was in an artistic frock
              of soft blue, with a touch of the same colour
              in her hair. Mrs. Bailey was in pink, with an
              old-world tucker in the corsage, and Mrs.
              Heller was wearing a most becoming empire
              gown of black chiffon with appliquées of shad-
              ed pink roses on this skirt, and pink ribbons
              threaded in the lace decollatage. Mrs. Winn
              was in white, with many rufflings of ribbon and
              much fine lace, and had a pink rose tucked in
              her hair. Mrs. C. James was in turquoise blue
              silk with a sash of shaded chené ribbon, with a
              twist of blue threaded through her coiffure.
              Mrs, Maclean was in black, but made over
              white. Mrs. Allan Joseph brought Miss Joseph
              and her two girl friends, the latter both in
              white, while Miss Joseph was in pink crêpe-de-
              chine. Supper was served at about midnight,
              when over eighty refreshed themselves before
              dancing out the remainder of the programme.</p></div>

            <head>REVOLUTIONISTS ARRESTED</head>
            <head>ARMISTICE ANNOUNCED</head>
            <p>Moscow, December 29</p>
            <p>The whole of the revolutionary committee
            was arrested yesterday, and a quantity of
            bombs and explosives seized. The attack on
            the police barracks was repulsed with great
            loss. The revolutionists afterwards distributed
            pamphlets announcing an armistice. The
            workmen’s council met in the evening to
            consider the abandonment of the strike. (R.)</p>
            <p>Moscow, December 29</p>
            <p>The members of the revolutionary committee
            have been arrested in consequence of the assas-
            sination of the chief of the secret police. There
            is not so much firing now.	(Havas.)</p>
            <p>St. Petersburg, December 29</p>
            <p>Hopes are still entertained for the early
            pacification of Moscow.	(Havas)</p></div>

              <head>NEW P. AND O. STEAMER
              LAUNCHED.</head>
              <p>A new steamer, the Devanha, has just been
              successfully launched from the yard of Messrs.
              Caird and Co., Greenock. She is one of four new
              twin screw vessels, each of 8,000 tons gross,
              built for the P. and O. Company’s Bombay
              China mail and passenger services. Having
              regard to the fact that these ships
                almost continually employed in tropical waters
                the cabins, both first and second class, are
                placed all upon the upper or hurricane deck
                and are unusually spacious and well ventilated,
                all being what are known as “outside" cabins.
                The Delta, the first of these vessels, recently
                arrived at Bombay, and, although very rough
                weather was experienced on the voyage, she
                was found to be exceptionally steady.</p></div>

                <head>Expedition to Esneh</head>
                <p>The Institute of Archaeology of the Uni-
                versity of Liverpool has dispatched an ex-
                pedition to make explorations and excava-
                tions in the vicinity of Esneh. The funds
                have been privately subscribed by Liver-
                pool citizens. The excavations will be under
                the charge of the University Reader in Egyp-
                tology (Mr. J. Garstang), assisted by Mr. E.
                Harold Jones. A third member of the staff of
                the same Institute, Mr. Percy B. Newberry, is
                already at work in Egypt upon the history of
                the ancient civilisation of this country, under
                the endowment of Sir John Brunner.</p></div>

                <head>EGYPTIAN ANTHROPOMETRY</head>
                
                <p>In the latest volume of the journal of the
                Anthropological Institute (vol. xxxv, part i)
                M. C. S. Myers continues his contributions to
                Egyptian anthropometry by an investigation
                the compantive anthropometry of the ancient
                and modern inhabitants, in which he arrives at
                a different conclusion from that announced
                by Miss C. D. Fawcett in Biometrika for 1902.
                He considers that there is no evidence that
                the prehistoric and modern population of
                Southern Upper Egypt differ in physical mea-
                surement, and that the homogeneity of the
                prehistoric, as determinable by standard de-
                viation, is the same as that of the modern
                population inhabiting like regions of the Nile
                valley. He finds that the relative correlation
                of cranial measurements in the prehistoric and
                modern papulation shows great irregularity
                and that much caution is needed in basing
                general conclusions as to the relative closeness
                of correlation on a few coefficients only.</p></div>

              <p>Les changements dans la cote d'Amérique
              indiqués par la clôture de vendredi dernier
              ayant été insignifiants, la séance écourtée de
              la matinée de samedi, qui a été presque jour
              férié, n’a eu aucune importance et après les
              rares transactions traitées, on a affiché des
              cours absolument égaux à ceux de la veille.</p>
              <p>Le repos a duré juequ’à mercredi. Cé jour là
              quoique l^Amérique ne nous ait apporté que
              deux points de baisse, l’ouverture a été calme
              et la finale faible et en baisse de près de 1/8 de
              tallari en moyenne sur toutes les échéances de
              la vieille receite. Mais la véritable surprise
              pour notre marché a été celle que nous ont
              servi New York et New Orleans venues respec-
              tivement avec 22 et 35 points de baisse et qui
              nous ont fait reculer jusqu’a près de 15 1/8
              pour le janvier. Toutefois, dans la soirée, la
              tenue a été quelqae peu meilleure et à la
              clôture on a remarqué que chacun partait avec
              un peu plus d'espoir pour la lendémain, espoir
              basé sur le pressentiment ou plutôt l'intérêt,
              mais qui s'est, heureusement pour les haussiers,
              quand même réalisé. Eu effet, la reprise d'une
              quinzaine annoncée ce matin par les marchés
              américains et qui a été un fait aussi inattendu
              que la baisse d’hier, a été nn véritable
              beaume pour notre corbeille et ce revirement
              de New Orléans a fait profiter nos prix d'une
              amélioration de 1/8 de tallari.</p>
              <p>En résumé, la semaine a fini sur la cote de
              15 11/32 pour le Janvier et de 15 23/32 pour
              le Mars, ce qui représente en définitive, sur la
              clôture dp vendredi passé, une perte de 1/4
              pour le premier mois et de 3/16 pour le dernier,
              tandis que dans le même laps de temps l'Amé-
              rique a reculé, d’après les cotes qui nous sont
              connues ce soir, de 17 points environ.</p>
              <p>Le Novembre, par contre, s’estenn peu mieux
              comporté, car la perte pour cette échéance n'est
              que de 5/32 et ce fait est dû à l'élargissement
              du report sur les mois rapprochés et au désir
              que montre la spéculation de se jeter sur les
              dates éloignées, ce qui est toujours un signe de
              la faiblesse du détenteur des contrats.</p>
              <p>Quoique réduite à presque trois journées de
              travail en tout, la semaine que nous passons en
              revue n’en a pas moins été intéressante sous le
              rapport des fluctuations; il n’en est cependant
              pas moins vrai aussi que, comme activité, le
              marché a laissé et laisse encore beaucoup à dé-
              sirer : les continuels changements subits et
              rarement justifiés désorientent la spéculation
              de notre place et ont fini par la fatiguer et c'est
              tout aussi bien à cette circonstance qu'au man-
              que de contre-partie sérieuse, quand les haus-
              siers veulent réalises, qu’il faut	attribuer
              l’hésitation qui se fait remarquer et	qui rend
              ou fait parsitre notre marché comine icchabile
            à réagir par lui-même. II est certain que cette
            situation ne s'éternisera point, mais pour le
            moment, cela est incontestable, la tendance
            n'est guère favorable.</p>
            <p>Le mouvement de baisse qui avait commencé
            en Amérique et qui s'est arrêté, va probable-
            ment reprendre; dans tous les cas, il ne
            constitue pas un fait nouveau, car il y a long-
            temps déjà qu’on le prédisait ou prévoyait. Et
            quant aux	causes qui l'ont engendré, elles
            consistent, au dire des dépêches qui depuis
            quelques jours nous viennent de New York et
            de Liverpool, en plusieurs faits qui ont leur
            importance et qui méritent d'être retenus,
            soit, notamment, arrivages dépassant toute
            attente, pronostics	comme recettes pour les
            deux prochains mois supérieurs à toute idée
            qu’on s’en faisait, situation politique inquié-
            tante et desir intense du Sud de yendre. On a
            parlé en outre de la liquidation des positions
            des Outsiders de Wall Street, largement inté-
            ressés dans les cotons et que le resserrement
            d’argent sur la place de New-York oblige
            aujourd’hui à se débarrasser de leur marchan-
            dise, ainsi que de la réserve de Manchester
            qui, quoique engagé pour de longs mois encore
            et quoique soutenu, ne trouve pas moyen
            d'entamer de nouvelles affaires importantes.-
            On ne peut certes discuter ce qui est avancé
            sur la question de la récolte et qui peut être
            tout aussi vrai qu’entâché d'exagération, mais
            les deux derniers points sont à examiner:
            La position de Wall Street constitue au fond
            le point de départ, car c’est elle que l'on
            visait et rien ne nous dit que le jour où,
            par suite de la baisse, elle aura entière-
            ment disparu, nous ne verrons pas les chefs
            des clans baissiers actuels tourner casaque
            dans l’espoir de réussir un mouvement dans
            le sens opposé ; quant à l'abstention de la
            filature, ne serait-il pas logique de penser que
            ce qui lui fait défaut aujourd'hui, c'est-à-dire
            les nouvelles commandes, affluera chez elle
            quand la véritable consommation croira que
            la baisse a dit son dernier mot? Les situa-
            tions, tout naturallement, changent suivant
            les circonstances et surtout suivant les prix!</p>
            <p>Maintenant, comme résumé de l’opinion qui
            prévaut même parmi quelques-uns de ceux qui
            ont été les plus assidus à prêcher la baisse, on
            dit que si les cours sont inévitablement desti-
            nés a tomber encore, celane signifie pas que l'on
            doive désespérer de l'avenir, mais que ceux qui
            seront entrés dans l’article à un niveau modéré,
            comparativement aux prix que nous avons eus
            eu dernier lieu, auront pour eux toutes les
            chances de réus ite : la consommation actuelle
            est forte et, à tout prendre, elle continuera a
            l'être, can pou plus tard, il y aura sur le tapis
            la question de la laine, chère et n'offrant pas
            un approvisionnement sufficant, sinsi que le
            déficit, désormais constaté, des récoltes du Lin
            et de la Jute qui nécèssiteront des remplace-
            ments partiels en cotons.</p>
            <p>Le marche du disponsible est lolu d’avoir été
            brillant : il a non seulement souffert de l’inter-
            ruption des affaires es contrats, mais la de-
            mande en ellée-même du duhors et de la part de
            nos exportateurs a été leute et peut-être plus
            lente que ce n’est généralement le cas à l’épo-
            que des fêtes de fin d’année. Et pour ce qui est
            des prix qui avalent fléchi en sympathie avec
            les futurs, ils se sont relevés aujourd'hui et
            finissent à la même cote que vendredi dernier.</p>
            <p>Les exportations de la semsine ont constitué
            une petite: désillusion pour les intéressés à la
            hausse avec leur total de Balles 16,000 contre
            Balles 22,000 pour la même huitaine en 1904.
            On s’attendait à mieux, mais l’on espère main-
            tenant une compensation pour la semaine
            prochaine, qui est la première du mois, d’au-
            tant plus que pour l’année passée pour la
            même période il n’y a eu que 16,000 Balles.</p>
               
                <p>Le mouvement de b récolte, eu égard à son
                importance, continue dans des conditions nor-
                males, l'avance dans les recettes étant de Can-
                tars. 180,000 et dans les exportations de 150,000
                Cantars. Quént au stock, il n’est que de 31,000
                Cantars en moins. Comme retraits, le surplus
                des expéditions à cette date se partage en parts
                égales entre l’Amérique et l’Angleterre.</p>
                <p>Réduite à la portion congrue, la semaine n’a
                pas pu être trop favorable à Liverpool pour
                nos cotons ; aussi tout ce que l'on peut dire
                est que les ventes ont été insignifiantes, que le
                disponible est resté invariable et que les futurs
                se présentent en définitive avec cinq points
                de baisse.</p>
                <p>L'Américain n’a pas été mieux traité sous le
                rapport de l'aotivité, et pour ce qui est des prix
                les variations sont égales à peu près aux diflé-
                rences enregistrées en Amérique soit en tout
                10 à 12 points de baisse.</p>
                <p>Graines de Coton</p>
                <p>La semaine a été favorable au disponible
                tant par suite de la demands, que de la
                meilleure tenue des contrats. Le fait est que
                les cours en ont profité et que ce matin ils
                ont fini à 58 1/2.</p>
                <p>Les exportations sont restées inférieures
                aux prévisions et cela à cause des iêtos et de
                quelques retards de la part de certains bateaux
                à charger, mais ce qui est différé n’est pas perdu.</p>
                <p>L’Angleterre semble toujours bien disposée
                pour nos graines et n’edt pas du tout récal-
                citrente à répondre à tout raffrrmissement de
                notre marché. Hull paierait aujourd'hui
                5 16/3.</p></div>

<head>FIRST WINTER MEETING.</head>
<p>Fine, clear weather and a warmer sun than
had been felt for weeks past marked the first
Winter Meeting of the H. S. C., and it was
not surprising that the races were capitally
attended, while the sport itself was very
fair, though there were no peculiarly exciting
finishes, and the Pari Mutuel did not pay
wonderfully well for places, though the backers
of Lakik (ex Rais) for a win in the third race
were well rewarded. Among those present we
noticed H. H. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, Lieut. -
Gen. Lance, C.B., Capt. Gillson, Mr. Verschoyle,
Mr. and Mrs. Soott-Dalgleish, Mr. and Mrs.
Stout, Mr. Moberly, Capt. and Mrs. Claude
Rome, Mr. Rafferty, Major and Mrs. Spong,
Mrs. Wynn, Mr. and Mrs. Somers, Capt. and
Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. and Miss Nungovich, Dr.
A. J. Bentley, Ishak Bey Hussein, Ibrahim
Bey Cherif, Ahmed Bey el Bakri, Omar Bey
Sultan, Moharrem Pasha Chehin, and many
others.</p>
<p>The railway communications worked very
well this time, contrary to certain experiences
of last year, and but for a trifling delay on
the return journey there was nothing what-
ever to criticise in the railway arrangements.
The Band of the 1st K. R. Rifles played
selections during ths afternoon which were
much appreciated. The following are particu-
lars of the racing :</p>

<head>FASHION NOTES.</head>
<p>The weather was uncommonly kind to all
those who journeyed out to the Helouan race
meeting yesterday, and a brilliant sun shone
brightly all the afternoon, much to everybody’s
satisfaction. A good number of Cairo people
were present, and nearly all the ladies were in
cloth tailor-made suits, though a certain num-
ber took advantage of the sunshine and donned
more summery attire. Captain and Mrs. Wilson
were there receiving the congratulations of their
many friends, Mrs. Wilson wearing a pretty
pale blue frock and black hat with many roses
tucked under the back of the brim. Mrs. Claude
Lome looked well in a smart black and white
check suit, the belted coat having a short
barque and pale blue embroidered revers, and
round her shoulders a beautiful sable boa. Sable
was also worn by Mrs. Somers over a perfectly
fitting frock of palest grey cloth. Her toque
was of the same fur. Mrs. Winn, who is always
a striking figure, was gowned in white cloth
with a sable stole. Her small toque of vivid
green with one white camilla was draped with
an enormous flowing veil of green. Mrs. Stout
was in a very neat coat and skirt of grey cloth
with cuffs and revers of black velvet, and Mrs.
Spong was in white with much brown tulle in
her hat. Mrs. Nungovich was wearing black
doth inlet with pale blue, which blue toned in
with the superb engraved turquoise on her
chain and in her hat of ermine. Miss Nungo-
vich was much admired in her soft grey suit
with a large white fox around her shoulders.
Mrs. Herrling, who was with her, was in white
with a pale blue chiffon hat.</p>

<p>For the sake of other mothers, I must tell
you how your Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
have helped me.</p>
<p>I have never been strong, and can trace
my kidney trouble back to the days of my
childhood: Even when a girl in my teens, I
was.tired and drowsy all the day, and didn't
get restful sleep at nights. As I grow in years,
I seemed to get worse, being irregular, and
having attacks of palpitation and nervousness.
Between 16 and 17 years of age I couldn’t go
up half a dozen stops without resting; if I
attempted to, I fell down. About this age,
too, I began to be troubled with sharp pains
in the small of the back, and was sometimes
taken with dizzy spells.</p>
<p>Time after time I had medicine from the
doctor, but it didn’t seem to help me at all.</p>
<p>After my 21st birthday, I became more
regular, and my health improved, although I
still suffered now and then from backache,
headaches, and dizziness, and the secretions
werfe irregular in passing. I married when I
was 24 years of age, and have had, in all, six
children, the five born before I began with
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills being premature.
The first lived only 11 months, the second and
third are still living ; the fourth lived only 24
hours, and the fifth died within three weeks.</p>
<p>It was about 12 months ago that I began
taking Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, having
heard them spoken highly of. The first box
relieved me a good deal, and I bought some
more which considerably eased my back and
improved my appetite. By keeping on with the
medicine, I grew better in every way. Shortly
after this, I gave birth to my sixth child ; it is
the only child not prematurely born, and is going
on splendidly—better, in fact, than the other two
who survived. It it just two months old now.</p>
<p>Altogether I have used six boxes of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they have done
me more good than all the doctors’ medicine.
I sleep better at nights, my appetite is im-
proved, and I am a healthier woman now than
I have been for many years.</p>
<p>You are weloome to publish these facts, and
I shall be glad if my experience proves helpful
to other mothers.</p>

<head>THE ABBASSIEH OASIS</head>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
<p>Sir,—The remarks of the Financial Adviser
on speculation in land are of some interest, but
it is strange that there is no allusion in this
part of his Note to tbhe Abbassieh Desert affair.
Sir Vincent Corbett states with a full sense of
the responsibility attaching to his opinion that
Egypt is not an El Dorado for investors. If,
however, the Egyptian Government, advised
by him, is prepared to offer any more land on
similar terms to the Ahhassieh deal, there is
still an El Dorado in this country, richer than
the wildest dreams of a varice. The public still
await an explanation of the Abbassieh Desert
Oasis affair, and also some information as to the
prices already being asked by the happy con-
cessionnaires for plots of this land.—I am, etc.,</p>

<head>THE INCIDENT OF DECEMBER 10.</head>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
<p>Sir,—I have read with much interest, in
your columns, the opinions expressed by several
correspondents at to the cause, effect, and
importance, of the row which occurred in
Alexandria on the 10th inst. According to
some, it was a premeditated outbreak of some
importance whereas others affect to regard it
as little more than a Sunday afternoon’s amuse-
ment ; others again fancy that it was due to
turbulent foreigners, and others say that it
was an expression of native discontent.</p>
<p>Your most recent correspondent on the
subject, who hails from Port Said, regards it
with mixed feelings, for within the limits of
the same column be admits that it might be a
blessing in disguise, and then goes on to speak
of it as the disaster which we have to deplore.
This gives evidence of a lack of logic not often
to be found in your paper; many of the
opinions expressed in this letter are quite
irrelevant to the subject, and show so little
knowledge of Egypt, that I should recommend
your correspondent in future to confine his
observations to Port Said.</p>
<p>However much opinions may vary about
the incident of the 10th December, the fact
still remains, that it was sufficient to justify
the authorities in arresting several hundred
people, and it has entailed no small amount of
work and responsibility on the judges of the
Native Tribunals, who appear to have acquit-
ted themselves of their difficult task with
laudable impartiality.</p>
<p>While it is useless to deny that the incident
was of some importance, it is equally pleasing
to note, that although all sorts of rumours
were current that there would be a renewal
of the disturbance, all the European colonists
here were able to go about their business or
their pleasure much as though nothing had
happened. Some of us know from sad experience
that such is not the case in a neighbouring
country when such incidents occur —why
did we have this feeling of security? The
answer to this question is clear : it is because
the British flag flies on the Kom el-Dik Fort,
and the White Ensign in the harbour of Alex-
andria, and if the latter is not always there
it is not far to seek.—I remain, etc.,</p>

    <p>Robert Downing, The Famous Tragedian.</p>
    
<p>In speaking of Paruna, Robert Down-
ing, ths famous tragedian, says:
“You may notice that persons in poor
health always find the heat most intol-
erable; this I avoid by using Peruna. 1
know by the thermometer that the
weather is hot, yet I have felt the heat
less this summer than ever.</p>
<p>"I find Peruna a preventative against
all sudden summer ills that swoop upon
one in changing climates and water.
It is the finest traveling companion and
safeguard against malarial influence.</p>
<p>“The cooling action of Peruna on the
mucous membrane makes it invaluable

with that tendency to sudden hoarseness
so apt to overtake one on emerging from
a hot dressing room to a draughty

            <p>(Au jour d'hui a midi et demis)</p>
            <p>Bien que nous soyons un samedi, la cor-
            beille des valeurs a présenté une animation
            exceptionnelle,en prévision sans doute des deux
            jours de chômage qui vont suivre et de la
            brièveté de la séance de ce matin qui a olôturé
            à 11 heares et demie.</p>
            <p>L’activité a porté sur toute la ligne, mais
            principalement sur la National Bank, l'Agricole
            les Estates, la Salt & Soda et la Nungovich.</p>
            <p>La hausse inauguree hier en Obligations
            Crédit Foncier s'accentue aujourd’hui de 325 à
            332. On a même fait à un moment donné 334.</p>
            <p>Un engouement semblable a eu lien pour
            la Banque d'Abyssinie qui a ouvert à 7 1/4
            soit en hausse d'une demi-livre sur le prix de
            clôture d'hier. Vers la fin, cependant, le cours
            a fléchi à 7 1/16 vendeurs.</p>
            <p>La Nungovich gagne toujours du terrain.
            Elle s'avance de 11 1/2 à 11 9/16, avec de
            nombreuses transactions.</p>
            <p>De 9 5/16 l’Agricole remonte aussi à 9 3/8
            et la Cassa dî Sconto de 213 1/2 à 215.</p>
            <p>Et les petites valeurs ne sont pas moins
            favorisées ; l'Investment reprend de 1 5/32
            à 1 3/16, la Delta Land de 2 1/16 à 2 1/8 et
            la New Egyptian de 29/3 à 29/6.</p>
            <p>Les Estates, continuant leur mouvement
            ascensionnel, atteignent le cours de 1 9/16
            vendeurs.</p>
            <p>Eu revanche, les Markets fléchissent de 26
            à 25/9, la Nile Cold Storage de 11/16 à 5,8 et
            la Banque d'Athènes de 130 à 129 1/2.</p>
            <p>Les Sucreries se relèvent peu à peu. On a
            clôturé à 30 aujourd’hui.</p>
            <p>Il y a hausse également en Khedivial Mail
            de 4 3/8 à 4 7/16. L’Ordinary gagne 3 pence
            à 26.</p>
            <p>On voit par ce cours aperçu que l’ensemble
            de notre marché est excessivement forme. Une
            pareille venue es fin d’année fait présager une
            brillante ouvertore pour l'année qui com-

            <head>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</head>
            <p>Caire 29 Décembre.</p>
            <p>Le taux d’escompte à Londres vient d'être
            de nouveau élevé à 4%	ce qui doit, assuré-
              ment, être attribué aux besoins considérables
              d'argent qui se manifestent d'habitude dans les
              derniers jours de l’année. Le Consolidé anglais
              est renseigné invarié, de même que toutes les
              valeurs égyptiennes.</p>
              <p>A Paris égalemént, l’action Crédit Foncier
              est signalée stationnaire à 778. La Banque
              d'Athènes est en hausse de 2 francs à 126.</p>
              <p>Ici, le marché des valeurs a été, ce matin,
              tort animé et en- excellente tendance. Ces bon-
              nes dispositions font espérer que, les fêtes pas-
              sées, janvier donnera plus de satisfaction.</p>
              <p>Les transactions out été très nombreuses en
              National Bank et en Agricole; la première a
              clôturé en hausse d’un 1/4 de livre à 25 7/16 ; la
              seconde à 9 5/16. La Cassa di Sconto a gagné
              6 francs à 214. L’action Crédit Foncier, en
              bonne demande, s’est inscrite à 781 ; l’obliga-
              tion à lots 1886 a haussé de 6 francs à 325.</p>
              <p>L'Immobilière a avancé de 330 à 338. Le
              projet consistant à construirs la nouvelle Bour-
              se du Caire sur un des terrains de la Société
              n’est peut être pas stranger à ce mouvement.</p>
              <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovich
              out ouvert à 11 3/8 pour clôturér à 11 1/2 sur de
              forts achats. Les Upper Egypt ont clôturé à
              5 5/32. Les National Hotels se sont maintenus
              à leur prix précédent.</p>
              <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptian
              sont soutenues à 29.6 acheteurs. Les Estates,
              très mouvementés, ont clôturé à 1 17/32. Les
              Salt and Soda ont gagné 1 shelling à 21.3.</p>
              <p>Les Sucreries d'Egypte ont, elles mémes,
              haussé de 5 francs à 30.</p>
              <p>Alors qu’on s’attendait à une accentuation
              de la baisse sur le coton par suite dee nouvelles
              d’hier, les marchés d’Amérique nous transmet-
              tent, au contraire, des cours en hausse; le spot
              a gagné 5 points, le Janvier et le Mai 14 point
              respectivement. Liverpool est également plus
              ferme.</p>
              <p>Ici, ce matin, le Mars a ouvert à 15 3/4 pour
              clôturer au même prix.</p>

          <head>OUR LONDON LETTER.</head>
          <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
          <p>London, December 21</p>
         <p> Quem Jupiter vult perdere—whom Jove
          would destroy he first deprives of reason. The
          saying’s worn, but no other meets the case of
          C.B. With inconceivable candour and self-
          destructive obstinacy he outlined at the Albert
          Hall last night such a policy as the British
          Empire has never been asked to consi-
          der, save in nightmares. This Liberal
          programme is simplicity itself. Our arma-
          ments, the pledges of peace which the
          strong man armed can provide, the means
          which made possible the successful foreign
          policy of Lord Lansdowne (which C.B. finds so
          "pleasant" an outlook) and the many arbitra-
          tion treaties concluded by the Unionist Admi-
          nistration, are to be reduced. Free Trade is to
          take their place, and war is to be avoided, not
          by the knowledge that we can defend onr own
          interests, but by our power to buy off our ene-
          mies with enlarged opportunities for "dump-
          ing.” And. this is C.-B.’s answer to Mr. Balfour
          and Mr.Chamberlain:</p>
          <p>After this it need surprise no one to know
          that Lord Kitchener is directly threatened,
          that trade onions are to be granted immunity
          from the legal restrictions placed on the con-
          duct of ordinary mortals, that economies are
          to be effected hy the Gilbertian process of
          removing all checks upon municipal enterprise
          and extravagance, that farmers are to he
          benefited by imposing fresh burdens on land
          so overburdened as to be already unprofitable,
          that the ratepayer is to be mulcted for a sop to
          the educational Cerberus, that the publican is
          to be robbed in the sacred name of intemperate
          Temperance, and that local control of its own
          affairs is to lead Ireland by swift steps to that
          separatist haven which is Home Rule.</p>
          <p>With excellent judgment and good taste
          Lord Curzon has declined the invitation to
          stand for the City. It was conveyed to him
          in terms of the highest compliment, and was
          backed by the signatures of men whose names
          speak for themselves, as rrpresenting the
          finance and commerce of London. It was,
          indeed, a great temptation, but Lord Curzon
          has, as might have been expected of him, risen
          superior to it, and has set an example which
          lesser persons would do well to follow. Rather
          than that his action should be a source of
          embarrassment to political parties, or "accen-
          tuate differences" which it would be his
          "single aim to unite,” he forgoes a unique
          opportunity of returning to public life, under
          conditions so appreciative of his character as a
          man and a high official.</p>
          <p>I am not surprised that Lord Welby, when
          questioned on Tuesday as to the fall in County
          Council stocks, replied that "he could not give
          a satisfactory answer.” While Consols have
          fallen 1 3/4 percent in the last nine months,
          London County Council securities have dropped
          4 1/4, and the explanation, while very far from
          "satisfactory," is even to the financial use
          phyte, sufficiently obvious. It was illustrated
          in a timely fashion by the proceedings of
            the Council itself yesterday afternoon. The
            sums voted at this single sitting included
            £139,000 for tramways, £110,000 for	workman's
            dwellings, £111,000 for a school training
            college, and £10,000 and £25,000 for other
            educational buildings—making, with odds and
            ends, a total disbursement of £700,000 for one
            afternoon. And this takes no account, of course,
            of the weekly £2,500 spent upon the steamboat
            procession. It is not surprising that the judi-
            cious investor should look shyly at the scrip of
            a municipality which is only happy when it is
            throwing money about.</p>
            <p>In an interesting report, just published by
            the Foreign Office, on the trade of Switzerland,
            some striking figures are given with regard to
            the travellers, commercial rather than globe-
            trotting, who visited the pleasure-garden of
            Europe during 1904. In the course of last year
            no fewer than 4,800 representatives of German
            houses obtained the requisite licences, whereas
            only 41 travellers from the United Kingdom
            made application for permits to solicit business
            in the various cantons. It is a notable fact,
            however, that although there were more
            than a hundred German travellers to our one
            in Switzerland, the totol imports from the
            Fatherland were only seven times the volume of
            British trade, which proves that our goods are
            in demand, despite our sad lack of enterprise.</p>
           <p> From the standpoint of the picturesque, it
            is excellent news that the roof of Chariot
            Cross Terminus is to be considerably lowered
            in height. That should render the hideous
            eyesore somewhat less obtrusive, and it may
            even be hoped that while reconstruction is in
            hand, the owners will take advantage of the
            opportunity to impart some architectural
            merits to the structure. But aesthetic improve-
            ment fades into insignificance, important
            though it be, compared with the revelation of
            public peril from the growing use of iron and
            steel, cast or wrought, in buildings. Such a
            wide variety of antagonists pronouncements
            from experts is appearing that no definite con-
            clusion can be drawn from their dogmas.</p>
            <p>The announcement that Mr. Beerbohm Tree
            will shortly take a touring company to Ger-
            many with a Shakespeare repertoire is one
            that wilL meet, of course, with an extremely
            cordial weloome from English residents in the
            Fatherland. But the significance of the visit
            goes further than this. It is, in a way, a return
            visit to that of the German Theatre in London,
            and an important item in the free interchange
            which is so valuable a stimulus of the world's
            art.</p>
            <p>It appears that the most terrible consequences
            of the Boer War have been overlooked. Many
            reputations were lost during the fighting. They
            were inconsiderable in comparison with the
            reputations that have taken flight since. The
            first were professional, and concerned only the
            national safely. The others are sartorial, and
            strike at the roots of the national beauty. In
            plain—awfully plain—language, the British
            officer who used to set the fashion in dress—
            where silk hats and frock coats were as near
            perfection as mortals could expect—returned
            from South Africa with a lowered sense of
            social demands and-his own personal respon-
            sibility. What South Africa began the develop-
            ment of the motor-car is completing. The
            “Outfitter” is almost in tears over the shame-
            ful carelessness now manifest in the beat circles.
            A Norfolk jacket and riding breeches, accom-
            panied by a cap and gaiters, are accepted “even
            on Sundays.” Carelessness in dress has become
            "firmly rooted” in the minds of the "gilded
            youth of this country," and if things go on as
            they are now going the "smartly groomed man
            will be as extinct as the dodo.” It is deplorable.</p>
            
            <p>Mr. George Herring’s gift of £100,000 will
            enable the Salvation Army to work out an
            experiment in "farm colonies" which should
            prove of the highest importance. It is of much
            significance that the money is only a loan as
            far as the Salvation Army is concerned—being
            ultimately payable by instalments to the King’s
            Hospital Fund—for this implies that it is
            hoped to conduct the undertaking on com-
            mercial lines, and to replace the capital intact
            after setting the scheme in operation. If this
            programme can really be fulfilled, it will mark
            a great advance in practical sociology.</p>
            
           <p> We must adapt Macaulay's famous conun-
            drum and inquire to-day whether, as civilisation
            advances, fecundity declines. According to Drs.
            Newsholme and Stevenson, who discoursed on
            the subject of birth-rates to the Statistical
            Society on Tuesday, the augmentation of the
            race is slowing down nearly everywhere. Ireland
            is the only country in which the cradles are
            being kept more busy than formerly, while the
            rest of the world is applying the philosophy of
            "comfort” in a way that has a marked influence
            upon statistics. It is some consolation to know
            that, while the English birth-rate is 17 per cent
            lower than twenty-two years ago, that does not
            represent an extreme retrogression, for Belgium
            and Saxony have each got a decrease of 24 per
            cent. against them.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that the Ireland and
            Craven scholar for this year at Oxford is a
            Rhodes scholar. It is a proof of the soundness
            of Mr. Cecil Rhodes' scheme, and of the excel-
            lent material hitherto lying dormant in the
            outlying parts of the Empire Indeed, efforts
            are already being made in other Universities
            to give encouragement to colonials to graduate.
            That they will hold their own in the athletic
            world may be deduced from the fact that three
            of the Oxford fifteen in the Varsity match of
            this year were from South Africa. Indeed, from
            the extraordinary success of the New Zea-
            landers, it is probable that undergraduates
            will come from the colonies to teach; not to
            learn, in this respect.</p>
            
            <p>In common with all who are interested in
            the genuine progress of the motor-car, I
            rejoice at the decision of the International
            Association of Automobile Clubs that there
            shall be no Gordon Bennett race next year.
            Nor, I understand, in any future year.
            While the motor car was still merely a new
            toy for a few rich men, the existence of such
            a competition was at any rate comprehensible.
            Its continuance now would be pointless and
            inexcusable. It is universally realised that
            the motor-car has a serious future before it,
            and that its development lies on the lines of
            reliability rather than of speed. But the
            fixture is not merely to be dropped ; it is
            proposed to substitute for it a competition of
            a practical kind for touring cars. The inter-
            national element, so valuable for purposes of
            comparison and improvement, will thus be
          preserved, but now at last it will directed
to its right and proper channel.</p>
<p>There is a locus classicus of a reporter, hav-
ing to transcribe his notes on a speech on
education at great speed, writing “kids”
throughout instead of "children." As is very
commonly done, he had used the shorter term
through his notes to save time. Exactly the
same thing has happened in the last speech of
Lord Durham's. He describes his horror at
finding himself reported as referring to Mr.
Chamberlain throughout as “Joseph" and
"Joey.” It was explained that the reporter had
written "Joe," and a sub-editor added the “y.”
A somewhat similar mistake has sometimes
been made in mentioning the names of speak-
ers. A reporter, ignorant of the names of those
on the platform, often pats down some personal
characteristic or feature, and inquires the name
afterwards. A reporter recently forgot to make
the inquiry, and the speaker figured as "Mr.
Clubfoot."</p></div>

<head>MOSLEM INSTABILITY.</head>
<p>The following article on some characteristics
of present-day Moslems appears in "Al
Moayad." The author is Mohamed Effendi
Kurdali, the popular and well-known Da-
mascene writer and editor of "Al Moktabas,"
a review which has recently made its appear-
ance in Cairo:-</p>
<p>"Our society is in a state of dissolution and
a condition of despair prevails among all
classes, who give way to a belief in destiny.
This lack of any strength of will and this
want of confidence in the future are great mis-
fortunes for the land. Had our great fore-
fathers developed th' same characterisitcs as
we have, they would have been as full of fear
and as poor of spirit even as we are. But on
the other hand they strengthened their charac-
ters and enlightened their minds by learning,
and trampled on all feelings of despair by
their zeal and understanding. When any one of
our leading men follows a fearless and upright
line of policy he is accosted by his fellows
with the question, Are you trying to make your
nation live for a hundred years while we have
enough to do to keep the race going for an-
other ten years ? What a difference is there
between this fatalistic point of view and the
English outlook on life. The people of that race
act to-day so that their deeds may bring forth
fruit hundreds of years hence. Had you looked
back on your history would you have thought
it possible that the men of the Crusades, men
of a united Christendom, who conquered Jeru-
salem and held the coast of Syria and
Egypt, would have been forced to withdraw
from these lands? Who would have thought
that the Moslems would have been strong
enough to force them to go away from those
countries, which they had ruled for two
hundred years? The future should ever be
considered by those who take though of the
passing day. Had the Moslems in those bygone
days given themselves over to despair and
placed their hopes solely on divine succour,they
would have lost their position and God alone
knows what would have beoome of Syria,
Palestine, and Arabia. Saleh-ed-Din el Ayoubi
and his statesmen were not acting in accord-
ance with the advice of scatter-brained council-
lors when they gave up the policy of hope-
lessness and by their zeal and foresight wrought
those mighty deeds, the fame of which still
re-echoes in the East. How can we compare
the present with those days of old and still
believe that heaven snd earth stand yet
where they did aforetime? Now-a-days our
motto is 'Everything by starts and nothing
long.' The best and only line of policy
for us, whether for the farmer in his farm
or the great man in his palace, is to develop
strength of will and firmness of purpose.
Education and culture should be our aims,
and indifference and hopelessnees should be
ruthlessly uprooted from our sentiments, for
to fail after a struggle is better for the develop-
ment of character than to gain success without
work."</p>
<p>In reading this description of the defects
of the Arab character we are reminded of
the recently published and remarkable work
of Mr. Phillips on the desert, with its subtle
analysis of the Arab. The Arab is the eternal
individualist, the antithesis of the citizen.
He is terrible in his sudden explosions of
nervous energy, terrible as the desert, he
he cannot endure, and, like the desert, he
can destroy but never build. His mind has
brilliance and swiftness, bnt neither profun-
dity nor coherence. Sometimes in bis paral-
lels Mr. Phillips is farfetched and fantastic,
but in the main his brilliant analysis carries
oonviotion, when he traces throughout the
history of Mohamedanism the desert spirit
which stops short of all complete achieve-
ment and endaring civilisation. It has the
force of a destroying angel, but it goes as
suddenly as it comes:-</p>
<p>"Orthodox Mohamedanism, reeking as it
does of the desert, energetic and militant, yet
failing in just the qualities which give depth
to thought and coherence to society, is, after
all, the best clue to the Arab's character
and history. It explains both his successes
and his failures. It explains the fury of his
attacks, the rapidity of his conquests, and
his success in destroying and consuming all
that is rotten, effete, and worn out in the
world. It explains the lack of definite pur-
pose in all his undertakings, and his failure
to build up anything durable and solid of
his own. It explains why in the twilight of
the middle ages he was so prominent and
terrible a figure, and why to-day he is back
in the desert once more.</p>
<p>This Arab strain in the Egyptian character
probably explains the complete failure of all
attempts to run native limited liability com-
panies.</p></div>
