                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are intended to leave

              <head>BISHOPRIC FOR KHARTOUM</head>
              <p>It would appear from Bishop Blyth’s written
              statements, and Bishop Wilkinson's sermon
              on December 17 in St. John's Church, West-
              ninster, as reported in the home papers, that
              a definite attempt is being made to raise
              funds for an English bishopric at Khartoum
              “as a Church Memorial to General Gordon."
              It seems somewhat strange to open a fund for
              a second English bishopric in Nile land before
              the first scheme—that for an English bishop-
              ric in Egypt—has met with any adequate
              support. The "Egyptian Bishopric Endowment
              Fund" stands at £8,952.11.1 and £20,000
              at least are required to establish the bishopric.
              The late Archbishop of Canterbury said, "Not
              less than £ 10,000 should be raised to put
              the bishopric on a firm financial basis.” A
              fund was opened in 1899, and in seven years
              has only secured a sum less than half the
              amount absolutely necessary ; last year the
              donations to the fund only amounted to a
              very few pounds (£8 17s. Od.).</p>
              
              <p>If it is desirable that we have a bishop of
              the Church of England in Egypt, surely it
              would be better to raise the remaining £11,000
              before starting another scheme for a second
              bishopric in the Nile Valley. In the Sudan ,
              which is united to Egypt by the Nile, there
              are only five clergymen of the Church of Eng-
              land at work, and three of these have only just
              arrived. At the present moment we have an
              archdeacon of the Church of England in the
              Sudan, and an archdeacon,(in Episcopal
              Orders) of the Church of England in Egypt.
              Until the £20,000 or £30,000 are raised to
              pay a living wage to the new bishop, might
              not the interest on the present endowment
              fund, which would be about £250 per annum,
              be (with the consent of the donors) applied to
              paying the expenses of our present archdeacon,
              who might be willing, if Bishop Blyth thought
              fit, to act as his representative in Egypt? As
              our archdeacon is also a bishop, surely this
              arrangement would meet the present needs of
              the English Church in Egypt and the Sudan.
              If English Churchmen in Egypt are con-
              vinced of the need for an independent bishop
              to represent, and preside over, their Church,
              they will no doubt, when approached, be
              willing to contribute to the fund. There are,
              we believe, about 27 clergy at work now in
              Egypt and the Sudan, and another 33 in Syria
              Cyprus. In New Zealand the average
              number of clergy to each bishop is 46; in
              Australasia 13 of the English bishops have an
              average of 37 clergy a-piece; and in the Amer-
              ican Church there is one bishop to 53 clergy.
              The time will doubtless soon arrive when it
              will be necessary for the welfare of the Church
              of England in Egypt that she should be
              fully organised with a bishop of her own.
              Meanwhile it would seem wise to seek to
              obtain the sum required for the bishopric
              proposed in 1899, before starting a second
              fund for the establishment of a second
              bishopric in the Sudan, which is after all but
              another portion of Nile-land, for the all-
              important river binds the two countries into
              one.</p></div>

              <p>African World Annual.
              We have received the "African World”
              Christmas Annual, a bulky production of about
              300 folio pages packed full of interesting
              information regarding every part of Africa,
              from the Cape to Cairo. Though the contents
              are mainly devoted to South African mining,
              a section which is of the utmost value to those
              interested in these ventures, space is found
              for a whole series of ably written and specially
              contributed articles, dealing with almost every
              phase of African activity—whether it be on
              mining, or on sport, politics, and travel. The
              literary value of the publication is very high
              and it is most profusely illustrated with photo-
              graphs and sketches. The editors and compilers,
              Messrs. Leo Weinthal, Hartley Knight, and
              Moses Roberts, are to be congratulated on a
              marvellously fine production. It costs 2s, and

              <head>THE PORTE’S CLAIMS.</head>
              <head>A TURCO-EGYPTIAN DISPUTE.</head>

              <p>A dispute between the Egyptian and Turkish
              Governments respecting the frontier separat-
              ing Egypt from the Benghazi District is report-
              ed by a Constantinople correspondent. Last
              year the Turkish Government caused barracks
              for a company of infantry to be erected at
              the further end of the Gulf of Sollom, from
              which the line of demarcation between Egypt
              and the district of Benghazi starts. The
              barracks, however, were erected at a point
              situated a little beyond the Turkish frontier,
              and the Khedive's Government therefore pro-
              tested against this encroachment by Turkish
              troops on Eyptian territory.</p>

              <p>To this the Porte only answered that there
              could be no question of any encroachment on
              a foreign soil on the part of Turkey, “since
              the villayet (province) of Egypt formed an
              integral part of the Ottoman Empire.”</p>

              <p>The sophistry of this argument did not
              escape the Egyptian Government. In order
              both to force the Turkish garrison in the
              barracks to quit Egyptian soil and to restore
              to Egypt her rights of territorial sovereignty
              not only over the entire district of Sollom but
              also over a district of about 250 kilometres to
              the west of that point, it is causing an Egyp-
              tian military post to be constructed at the
              farther end of the Bay of Bomba.</p>

              <p>The erection, therefore, of this Egyptian
              military post at Bomba will have for result
              the acquisition by Egypt of a considerable area.
              The frontier between Egypt and the Turkish
              district of Benghazi, which began, as the maps
              indicate, at Sollon, will now start from the
              Bay of Bomba, that is to say, will include
              about 250 kilometres more in the direction of
              the west.</p>

              <p>Recently the Turkish Council of Ministers
              discussed this question at great length, and
              decided that the Grand Vizier should address a
              communication directly to the Egyptian
              Government calling on it to give up the project.
              The Governor of Benghazi, Hilmy Pasha, has,
              on his side, received orders, to oppose by any
              means he may consider necessary the erection
              by the Egyptians of a military post at Bomba,
              supposing the Khedivial Government should
              refuse to take into consideration the communi-
              cation of the Grand Vizier.</p>

              <p>According to Turkish intelligence, an Egyp-
              tian despatch boat has been chosen to convey
              to Bomba the Egyptian soldiers whose duty it
              will be to erect the military post and thus to
              isolate from Benghazi the Turkish barracks at
              Sollom.</p>

              <p>The above statements emanate from Con-
              stantinople and we have not obtained con-
              firmation of them from any authorised Egyptian
              source.</p></div>

              <head>DJELLALEDDIN PASHA’S PROTEST TO THE SULTAN.</head>

              <p>The death of the Khedivial Princess who
              was the wife of General Ahmed. Djelaleddin
              Pasha and the sister of Prince Omar Pasha
              and Prince Djemil Pasha Toussoun, is still
              fresh in the minds of all, for the funeral, which
              took place at Alexandria, was one of the most
              solemn and largely attended inhumations that
              have taken place here for years past. Her body
              rests in the Mosque of Nebi Daniel.</p>

              <p>Since her death her husband, who for more
              than ten years was the most powerful and
              honorable of the Sultan's advisors, has re-
              sided in Egypt and resisted all the blandish-
              ments of the Sublime Porte to induce him to
              go back to Stamboul. His obstinacy has led, it
              is said, to the confiscation of his estates in
              Turkey, and now the Sultan has determined to
              blacken the character of his erstwhile favorite
              by ordering a commission to sit at Yildiz
              Kiosque in order to enquire into the circum-
              stances attending his wife's death. The Pasha’s
              case is fully set out in the telegram which he
              despatched to Tahsin Pasha, first secretary to
              the Sultan, on the 26th inst. The text of this

              les moyens les plus propices à atteindre la but
              proposé.</p>

              <p>La défunte princesse est inhumée an Egypte
              et son cercueil porte tonjours les soellés qui,
              conformément au règlement régissant le trans-
              fert des corps, ont été apposés par les antorités
              po'icières de la ville de Cannes, cu elle a
              rendu le dernier soupir. Tous ses parents,
              l'illusure famille á laquelle elle appartenait,
              sont domiciliés dans ce pays et j'y suis établi
              moi-même, principal intéressé. La haute re-
              nommés de justice et d’impartialité des tri-
              bunaux égyptiens demeurant au-dessus de
              toute contestation il serait donc tout-à-fait
              naturel de poursuivre ce procès en Egypte, ce
              qui assurerait l’exaltation entière de la vérité.</p>

              <p>Pourtant, si par une considération queloon-
              que le recours aux tribunaux égyptiens était
              jugé inopportun on rourrait parfaitement
              déférer le cas à la justice française, la prince se
              étant morte en France. Au surplus, je suis
              prêt à me présenter à la justice de tout pays
              civilisé où l'indépendance des tribunaux se
              tronve assurée.</p>

              <p>Mais la manière par laquelle l’enquête est
              inaugurée à Constantinople, la constitution
              d’une commission au palais de Yildiz, qui ne
              devrait en rien intervenir dans une affaire
              judiciaire, la pression exercée sur certains mé-
              decins (parmi lesquels d’auouns n’avaient d’ail-
              leurs jamais examiné la défunte princesse)pour
              leur faire apposer leurs signatures au-dassous
              d'un rapport préslablement préparé, les mena-
              ces proférées à cette occasion constituent au-
              tant de symptômes indiquant que l’enquête
              poursuivie à Constantinople marque, dans son
              origine même, de cette incérité dans la recher-
              che de la vérité qui constitue la condition
              essentielle de toute justice régulière.</p>

              <p>Aussi, il devieut indispensable dans l’intérêt
              même du but pousuivi de trausférer le procès
              devant une justice inaccessible à aucune ingé-
              rence et dont la procédure normale ne saurait
              subir aucune déviation.</p>

              <p>Cette proposition ne peut qu’être adoptée,
              s’il existe la moindre impartialité dans l’en-
              quête inaugurêe. Le triomphe de ceux qui la
              poursuiventrerait incontestables’ils parvenaient
              à obtenir une condemnation d’un tribunal
              jugeant en pleine possession de son indépen-
              dance. Le refus, au contraire, de porter l'affaire
              devant une justice impartiale, découvrirait de
              suite le but caché qui ne peut être autre chose
              que de porter une grave atteinte à ma dignité
              et à mon honneur. Ce sont là justement les
              seuls biens auquels je tiens dans l’exil volon-
              taire que je me suis imposé. En présence d’une
              pareille entreprise qui sous imposé d'une
              procès absurde, équivaut à déclarer une guerre
              ouverte contre mon honneur, toute considera-
              tion de convenance, tout souvenir d’anciennes
              bienveillances cessent d'avoir leur raison d'être.
              La responsabilité de cette nouvelle situation
              ne peut révenir qu’a ceux qui m’obligent de
              me départir de la neutralité que je me suis
              imposée vis-à-vis du vrai instigateur de ces
              intrignes. J'accepterai le combat et j'attendral
              avec confiance les hostilités pour défendre mon
              honneur et lui conserver dans le monde
              l’estime et la considération dont je suis fier
              da le voir entouré. Ce sera une nouvelle
              occasion pour manifester la puissance morale
              de l’honneur et affirmer son triomphe contre
              toute force qui voudrait l'écraser injustement.</p>

              <p>An Englishman, who knew the Pasha at
              Constantinople, thus describes him:-</p>

              <p>Djellaleddin Pasha was for years foremost
              and prime favorite among all the Sultan’s
              subjects, and fully deserved the trust
              reposed in him as an honorable and upright
              gentleman. His downfall, therefore, came as a
              shock to all who knew him, the greater,
              perhaps, for that the report added that
              he had been denounced by the Secret Police
              of the Palace, a force which he himself created
              and organised, and of which, among many
              offices, he has always been the working chief.
              A remarkable and singularly fascinating per-
              sonality, Ahmed Pasha’s most salient quality
              was ever an absolutely whole-hearted devotion
              to his master and when at last the enemies who
              ever dog the footsteps of Royal favorites
              succeeded in alienating from him Abdul
              Hamid’s confidence and affection, the cir-
              cumstance was received aa indicating a further
              sinister advance in the progress of that be-
              setting "manie de la persécution” which has
              for years haunted the gloomy potentate of
              Yildiz. During his long term of honored ser-
              vice Ahmed Pasha enjoyed an absolutely
              unique position in the Yildiz set. Privileges
              have been his which no other Turkish function-
              ary would have dared to solicit. Of late years, for
              instance, social communion between Turks and
              Europeans in the capital has been tacitly, and in
              some cases openly, prohibited. Yet Ahmed was
              a prominent member of the “English" club,
              and to which practically all the English colony
              belongs in common with the chief members of
              other European communities. Almost every
              day, indeed, Fridays excepted, during the
              many years I knew him, Ahmed Pasha took
              his place at the Bridge table—for Bridge was
              popular in Constantinople long before it was
              heard of in Europe, and it may be said that he
              is both a fine player and a good loser. It has
              often been suggested that this licensed associa-
              tion with Europeans was not wholly foreign to
              his functions as chief of the Secret Police. As to
              this, however, it may be said that all who have
              known the Pasha were penetrated with the
              sense of his complete honorability. In proof
              of this is the fact that when Abdul Hamid
              sought to end his differences with the
              chiefs in Paris of the ” Young Turkey ”
              party he employed in vain one intermediary
              after another until it was intimated to him
              that the services of Ahmed Djellaleddin as
              envoy would procure the desired result. The
              Pasha, therefore, was sent to Paris and on
              his representations the ” Young Turkey ”
              leaden complied with the Sultan’s invitation
              that they should return to Constantinople and
              their allegiance. It is noteworthy in this
              connection that Ahmed's influence with his
              master has sufficed to assure to them the
              immunity that he promised. It is within my
              knowledge that on several occasions he has
              been urged to diverge from this line of con-
              duct, and that at the risk of that loss
              of favor which has now overtaken him he
              invariably refused to put his hand to any
              unworthy action. Oddly enough, until now
              this inflexibility has served rather than injur-
              ed him in his master’s eyes : for the Sultan,
              though freely using spies and traitors, has
              a wholesome contempt for such gentry. Cover-
              ed with honors, only before his fall from
              favor recently, indeed, the Sultan bestowed
              on him the last and highest decoration in his
              gift.</p></div>

              was in such a bad state that the S.S Willis

              Zifta, Thursday.</p>

              <p>A meeting was held to-day, in a large tent
              near the Zifta Markaz, of the omdehs, mer-
              chants, and notables of the town and surround-
              ing villages. The Sub-Moudir of Gharbieh,
              Abdel Ghani Bey Shakir, the Mamour of Zifta,
              Hafez Effendi Amin, and many other notables
              were present. The Sub-Moudir opened the
              proceedings by a speech explaining the object
              of the gathering and urging them to help the
              kuttabs and their arifs, as many benefits were
              to be derived from them. The inspector of the
              kuttabs of Lower Egypt, Sheikh Mohamed
              Nassar, then said something as to the advant-
              ages of learning and education, their effect upon
              civilisation, the uses of the new kuttabs, and
              the necessity of spreading knowledge among
              Egyptians.</p>

              <p>The inspector of the kuttabs of the markaz
              also delivered a speech dealing with the new
              method of teaching in the kuttabs, and also
              recalled the Prophet’s sayings on the subject,
              pointing out that these new methods of teaching
              were the same as those enjoined by the Koran.
              He mentioned that there are now about
              sixty kuttabs in the district of Zifta at-
              tended by 3,528 scholars, of whom 105 are
              girls. He added that there was only one kut-
              tab in the whole district in 1902.</p>

              <p>Afterwards the grants-in-aid which amount-

              <p>Last night's dance at Ghezireh Palace Hotel
              was a most brilliant and enjoyable function.
              Over a hundred visitors and many residents,
              in addition to those staying at the hotel,
              were present, and many dinners were ordered.
              Among those dining were Col. Gordon, who
              entertained a large party, including General
              and Mrs. Bullock ; Lady Lampson, who pre-
              sided at a table of eight covers ; Major and
              Mrs. Hesse ; Mr. Curthy, who was entertain-

              Smiley, with a party of six ; Major Wilson,
              Mr. and Mrs. Fisher, and many others.</p>

              <p>Dancing started shortly after 10 o’clock, to
              the strains of the Tzigane Band, which played
              excellently. The floor was in good condition
              and dancing lasted till early this morning,

<head>COAL IN EGYPT.</head>
<head>IMPORTANT OPERATIONS OF CAIRO
SYNDICATE.</head>
<p>It is probable (the Financial News” remarks
in an article on the above subject) that some
time may yet elapse before the world at large
realises, with any approach to completeness,
the importance and the widespread significance
of the entente cordiale, which was initiated by
King Edward and M. Loubet and officially
formalated by Lord Lansdowne and M. Paul
Cambon in the early part of last year; but the
influence for good which thd Anglo-French
Agreement could not fail to exercise upon the
development and the growing prosperity of
Egypt, met with immediate and universal re-
cognition. Indeed, as Lord Cromer pointed out
in his latest annual report "on the finances,
administration, and condition of Egypt and
"the Sudan,” it cannot' be doubted that the
agreement constitutes a fresh point of depar-
ture in Egyptian affairs. Evidences of an
unmistakable character are already forth-
coming which leave no room for doubting that
in the comparatively near future Egypt will
take that high place among the great indus-
trial nations of the world which her vast
and mainly undeveloped natural resources
entitle her to hold. The work already ac-
complished by various undertakings in the
Nile Valley and in the Sudan has furnished
satisfactory assurances that, with careful selec-
tion and capable and honest management,
gold mining operations in the two countries
will become commeroially successful. Hitherto,
however comparatively little attention has
been devoted to the finding of coal in Egypt,
although it is self evident that the production
of coal of fairly good quality and upon even
a moderate scale would be little, if at all,
less important than the promised increase in
the output of precious metals. Mr. C. J.
Alford, in the course of the most voluminous
of his reports upon the geological features
of Egypt, said: "The tradition of the existence
of coal or carboniferous deposits in the Valley
of the Nile has been extant for many years.
About seventy years ago a party of French-
men are reported to have found some deposit
of coal or lignite in the Wady Keneh, about
18 miles north west of Keneh Town"; but
his time has been so fully occupied in the
search for gold that he has not been able to
pursue his investigations in regard to coal.</p>
<p>Nor can it be saidthat inquiries into the
subject have been encouraged by the Egyptian
Government Captain Lyons, whose report is
quoted by Lord Cromer, states that no reliable
evidence of the occurrence of coal in workable
quantity has yet been forthcoming, adding that
most of the strata are of marine origin, but,
in any case, the coal measures would underlie
the surface deposits ; so that the character of
the latter is by no means inconsistent with the
existence of coal in depth. However, the sub-
ject is not likely to remain much longer in
doubt. In the early part of the current year,
mainly on tha advice of Johnson Pasha the
Cairo syndicate was formed to take over from the
Government two concessions, one of about 400
square miles, known as the "Abou-Ra-Dham,’’
and the other comprising the whole of the
northern part of Sinai Peninsula, with an area
of over 12,000 square miles. At “Abou-Ra-
Dham" shafts which are said to have been
dug by Said Pasha have been discovered, and
there are local traditions of other shafts and
excavations. An excellent red hematite iron ore
is stated to be known to exist on the con-
cession—a valuable asset in itself, and still
more valuable if, as local natives assert, the
deposits were in ths old days smelted by means
of coal obtained near at hand. From the Sinai
Peninsula it is stated that coal and lignite
have often been brought to Suez, while in the
centre of the distriot ancient workings of im-
portant dimensions have been discovered.</p>
<p>Soon after the formation of the syndicate,
properly qualified and equipped expeditions
were dispatched to explore the two conces-
sions; but as at least fifty years must have
elapsed since the abandonment of work in the
big shaft at ''Abou-Ra-Dham," some time
must yet elapse before investigations can be
completed. Meanwhile several smaller pits
have been found, and, incidentally, it is stated
that some excellent samples of hematite iron
ore have been sent home from the property. In
the Sinai Peninsula the expedition arrived
early in September, and, after six days driving
with a shift of eight labourers, an old tunnel
was come upon intersecting the main one, the
latter being 5 1/2 ft. high and 4 ft. broad at the
top, and tapering to a width of 18 in. at the
bottom. From the excavations some solid
pieces of clean coal have been forwarded to the
syndicate. The coal-bearing strata, when re-
ported upon in September, was from 8 in for 9
in. to a foot in thickness, and the expert ad-
viser of the expedition states that the main
seam will shortly be reached. He adds that
the coal is clean and easily depicted from the
country rock, and remarks  “That the ven-
ture is now something more than a prospect
is certain, and fully warrants the expen-
diture of some capital. The operations of
the Cairo syndicate will be watched with
keen interest; for if it proves successful, as
seems highly probable, its success will mark
the beginning of a new era in the industrial
progress of Egypt. At present all the ooal .
consumed in the country has to be imported
at great cost, while the markets for the com-
modity which would be provided by Suez and
Port Said for vessels passing through the
world's greatest water-way and for shipment
to the East would unquestionably place the
local coal-mining enterprise in an extremely
prosperous condition.</p></div>

<head>IMMURED AS A LEPER.</head>
<head>CANADIAN'S TRAGIC ADVENTURE</head>
<head>HOW HE ESCAPED.</head>

<p>When an individual becomes a member of
the leper colony of Molokai, in the Pacific
Ocean, he is lost to the world; there is no cure,
no return, except in the rare case of an escape,
an almost impossible performance.</p>
<p>It has, nevertheless happened, and that
within the past three months. The facts reveal
tragedy and pathos transcending fiction, and
would scarcely be believed if they were not
vouched for by the best authority. For reasons
that will be readily appreciated, it is undesir-
able to mention the name of the gentleman who
through his brother’s help has just succeeded
in returning to freedom, if not happiness.</p>
<p>He is a Canadian, and was married in Janu-
ary 1890. A month later, while still on the
honeymoon, the young couple visited Honolulu.
After a few days' enjoyment of the life and
sights of the capital of the Sandwich islands,
the husband, at that time a man of twenty-
five years of age, failed to return to the hotel
for dinner. The anxious wife waited and waited,
and finally called in the assistance of the
Hawaiian police, but he had disappeared as
completely as though the earth had opened and
engulfed him.</p>
<p>The young woman cabled to her relatives in
British Columbia, and her father proceeded to
her assistance. Father and daughter remained
two months in Honolulu, and then, as there
was still no tidings of the missing man, they
returned home.</p>
<p>His parents were wealthy, and engaged the
services of a well-known American detective
agency, urging that no expense should be
spared to get at the facts of the disappearance.
A competent man was sent to Honolulu, and
after six weeks' patient investigation he dis-
covered what had happened.</p></div>
<div type= "item">
  <head>SEIZED AND DRUGGED.</head>
  <p>It seems that shortly after lunch on the day
  he disappeared he told his wife that he was
  going to the bank to draw some money, and
  that he would go to the club for an hour or so
  and return in time to take her for a drive
  before dinner. Immediately after leaving the
  bank, where he had drawn 500 dollars, he was
  arrested by four men, and, after being placed
  in a carriage, was driven to the house of 4
  native official doctor. Here, after the most
  cursory examination, he was declared to have
  leprosy, and when the necessary papers had
  been signed he was drugged.</p>
  <p>It is easier to imagine than describe what
  his feelings were when he awoke to con-
  sciousness and found himself lying in the hold
  of a little vessel bound he knew not whither.
  Although the island is less than forty miles
  from Honolulu, morning had dawned before
  Molokai was reached. On arrival he was left to
  take his place in the company of over a thous-
  and lepers. It was in vain that he protested,
  demanded his instant release, and refused to
  believe it possible that he was a prisoner there
  for life.</p>
  <p>When the report was made to the parents by
  the detective agency they did all in their
  power to obtain their son’s release, but in vain.
  Years went by. The distracted wife died of a
  broken heart. Later his mother died, and
  some months afterwards his father likewise.</p></div>
  <div type= "item">
  <head>A BROTHER'S SCHEME</head>
  <p>Fortunately for the lonely sufferer, he pos-
  sessed a brother a year younger than himself,
  who decided to spare neither himself nor his
  fortune in efforts at rescue.</p>
  <p>It was not found difficult to charter a vessel,
  that would carry off the man if he could reach
  it, but the difficulty was to enter into any com-
  munication with the people on the island, so
  that co-operation could be had from that
  source. A man was finally found who possessed
  a skin disease that in appearance might be
  mistaken for a form of leprosy. This man was
  poor, out of work, and with a family to provide
  for. He agreed for £2,000 to be paid to his
  wife to risk his liberty and life. He was taken
  to Honolulu, and accused of being a leper.
  The doctor who examined him had grave
  doubts, but the man’s statement that his father
  had contracted leprosy in a mild form in India
  before his marriage, also that later in life the
  disease became worse, and he died a loathsome
  object to look upon. removed them, and he
  signed the necessary papers, as he could con-
  ceive no reason why a man should voluntarily
  desire to proceed to Molokai as a resident.</p>
  <p>His arrival there brought tho first ray of
  hope into the life of the man who for fifteen
  years and six months had borne and endured
  such as few men have had to do in the history
  of the world. The two men were not long in
  meeting, and the plot for escape was unfolded.</p>
  <p>It was four nights later that a good-sized
  schooner yacht, which had been lurking off the
  is and out of sight all day, drew gradually
  closer, and by ten o'clook was within a hundred
  yards of a part of the shore least likely to be
  patrolled by the guards. No lights were shown,
  but occasionally small pieces of wood were
  thrown overboard coated with luminous paint.
  As the current was drifting shoreward, they
  were thrown on the beach in a short space of
  time. Suddenly to the watchers of those on
  board two pieces were raised in the air and
  held in that position. Immediately a boat with
  muffled oars made for the shore, and took on
  board, the two men who were in waiting, hav-
  ing eluded the guards in the darkness.</p>
  <p>Two weeks later the yacht arrived at Van
  couver, and the brothers were reunited. Doc-
  tors who have examined the elder say there is
  not the slightest trace of leprosy about him.
  The mystery is who caused his abduction.</p></div>

machines for the sale of goods. Its registered
premises were first at 4s, Upper Tusmes-street,
and afterwards at 109, Queen Victoria-street.
The company entered into an agreement with
Stewart Ross to buy certain property for the
purposes of its undertaking, and for this he
was to receive 12,500 shares in the company.
Stewart Ross was appointed chairman, and his
brother secretary pro tem, and at the first
meeting of the board the agreement to pur-
chase the property from Stewart Ross was
sanctioned. As a matter of fact, prior to
November, 1901, the liquidator of another
company, with whom the defendants had
been connected, had sold to a firm at King's-
cross some tons of automatic machines and
portions of machines at the price of scrap-
iron and those were afterwards sold for £145
to Stewart Ross. This was the property
which Stewart Ross subsequently sold to the
company, the books of which did not show
that any business had been done or that any
profits had been made. The company's shares
ware allotted in December, 1901, Stewart Ross
receiving about 14,000, which were described
as £1 paid. No cash, however, was paid for
them. The next step was to dispose of these
shares, and there could be no doubt that in
the early part of 1903 he was disposing of
large numbers of shares to the public at con-
siderable premiums. The premium was £1 7s
6d per snare, making about £11,000 in all,
and it was even being represented by Stewart
Row, when he was inducing others to buy
these shares, that they were changing hands
at from £2 to £2 10s. each. Mr. J.G. Prentice,
a marine insurance agent of Liverpool, and
Mr. J.E. Champneys, shipowner, of 27, Hans-
place, W., having had representations made to
them as to the value of the company's business
—Stewart Ross, in writing to Mr. Prentice,
having advised him not to miss such a "golden
opportunity "—and believing that the company
was to be taken over by another concern at
a considerable profit, invested in shares to
the extent of: Mr. Prentice, £525 17s 6d. ;
and Mr. Champneys, £648 7s 6d. Neither
of them knew, of course, that the shares
they purchased were portions of the ven-
dor's shares allotted to Stewart Ross.
The Anglo-Egyptian Company promoted the
British and Colonial Automatic Trading Co.
(Ltd.) in June 1903, which was to take over
the former and other firms' businesses, at
£12,000 in cash and £40,000 in shares, but
this company was wound up in about eight
months, and no portion of cash or shares—even
if they were taken up—went to the Official
Receiver. The Anglo-Egyptian Company was
subsequently also wound up, the liabilities to
unsecured creditors being set down at £7,162.</p>
<p>Evidence in support of the charge having
been given, the accused were remanded till
Jan. 17, bail being accepted for Stewart Ross
in £700 and George Ross in £500.</p>
<p>Bail for both prisoners was immediately
forthcoming.</p></div>

<head>OUR PARIS LETTER.</head>
<p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
<p>Paris, December 23.</p>
<p>The Parisians go about spiriting for Christ-
mas and New Year with a somewhat heavy-
hearted gaiety. As with all impressionable
people, the fit, either of exhilaration or de-
pression, is severe while it lasts. For the
moment the depression is uppermost. At no
period during the past few years has there been
so much talk of military preparation as at the
present moment. The more serious journals
preserve a reticence of language and do not
treat directly of the affair ; but columns are
devoted to the question of national defence. In
the lesser prints the issue is plainly stated
with details of an alarming character. One of
the evening newspapers, for instance, declares
that a deputy for Nancy drew the attention of
M. Etienne,the Minister of War,to the defence-
less state of the capital of French Lorraine,
in view of an invasion, and prayed for rein-
forcements. The Minister replied that he fully
shared the anxieties of the inhabitants, but he
was unable to gratify their wishes. “If I
increase the garrison," he said, "it would be
interpreted as an act of war and would be
responded to by an instant march across the
frontier." An unfortunate factor in the situa-
tion is that, whilst the greatest liberty exists
in France for the printing of the movements of
troops, the German Government allows no
essential secret to escape from the argus-edye
censor.</p>
<p>Fears for the situation abroad consort ill
with natural preoccupations for the situation at
home. Parliament is no longer sitting, and a
portion of the country is in the throes of elec-
tion preparations. One hundred Senators will
be returned to the Upper House in the first
week in January. From the political com-
plexion of those Republican Lords may doubt-
less be gauged the political temper of the
country. Patriotism belongs to no party
exclusively, but the fighting spirit or the
pacific spirit will probably be sufficiently indi-
cated by these hundred new Senators. One
should be able to draw some significant con-
clusions as to the voting of the National
Assembly in the latter weeks of January.
Rarely has a Presidential election been invest-
ed with such interest for the outside world.</p>
<p>The younger generation and the Army itself
are convinced that war cannot be avoided.
They argue that the Conference can only
increase the irritation already existing between
the two nations. France will not yield one
particle of her rights nor the neighbour one
jot or tittle of her pretensions. The only issue,
therefore, is an armed issue. Thus the young
men I was witness yesterday of a curious
scene very eloquent of the present temper of
the nation. A large party sat at a luncheon
table in a well-known club. In the midst of
conversation one of the number, a very learned
and cultured man, though hopelessly out of
touch with everyday affairs, advanced the
theory that Germany had a certain amount of
right on her side. Instantly, the table was in a
flame. There was a shout of indignation fron
the younger men, and two elderly gentlemen
arose and pointed a finger of scorn at the
anti-patriot.</p>
<p>In the absence of precise information at
this moment, it is supposed that Germany will
declare Madrid to be too distant from Morocco
to answer the purposes of a Conference. More-
over, it is estimated that this new difficulty
will give the vacillating Sultan another op-
portunity of showing his talents for procrasti-
nation. The doubts as to the attitude of
England are not entirely based on a disbelief
in the effective support of the new Govern-
ment ; they reside in an appreciation of the
historical reluctance of England to under-
take experiments not absolutely connected
with her self preservation. I was arguing the
point the other day with a distinguished
student of foreign politics when he remarked :
"We are so apt to forget that Great Britain
is an island. It should not be forgotten,
however. It is so easy for John Bull to retire
to his island and look dispassionately upon
European complications." These words have
an ungracious sound, but I believe they re-
present a widespread opinion. According to these
critics, the British policy has often been with
this country to a certain point, and then has
turned at a critical moment in another di-
rection. The Mexican campaign and the
Franco-German war are supposed to be exam-
ples of this disconnected friendship. Not to
put too fine a point upon it, it is believed
that the foreign policy, irrespective of the
colour of the home administration for the time
being, is founded upon immutable doctrines
of self-interest. It will need much firmness
of the British representatives at the Confe-
rence (if ever it takes place) to dissipate this
idea.</p>
<p>Information of a most reliable character
would lead one to suppose that the French
army has never, since the days of Napoleon,
approached a greater state of efficiency than at
this moment. If there is a weakness on the
purely military side, it is to be found in the
high commands; the young school of officers,
however, is, technically, the equal of the Teu-
tonic etat-major. And yeti the conviction re-
mains that, notwithstanding the preparedness
and notwithstanding the martial ardour of the
moment, this nation would, in its highest
expression, feel itself unequally matched. It is
for this reason that I refuse to believe in the
imminence of war. If supreme pressure comes,
it it to be foreseen that France will again resort
to tactics of conciliation. That is to suppose
that the authorities in the State are conscious
of an essential inferiority. In what direction
may we look for it? I do not know whether it
resides in the Commissariat or in some other
department, but if I have correctly surmised,
then war is relegated to some distant date
when the defect, whatever it is, has been
successfully remedied.</p>
<p>As to the conference it is worth noting that
many people here think that for many reasons
it would be preferable that there were no Con-
ference at all; on the other hand, exactly the
same conditions and exactly the same danger
would exist as before the opening of the present
period of diplomatic tension between France
and Germany. The work of Peaceful Penetra-
tion in Moroeco is at a standstill, and yet such
condition of things cannot last indefinitely
without doing great prejudice to French in-
terests in Algeria. The position which allowed
the turbulrnt Moorish tribes to commit acts
of brigandage on the frontier must be im-
proved by bringing organised pressure to bear
upon the Sultan, unlees France is prepared to
see anarchy in her own possessions. “To be
or not to be," is the question that confronts
the Gallic Hamlet with as muoh disquieting
force as Shakspeare's Prince of Denmark.</p>


<p>Out of evil, good. One remarkable feature
of the crisis is the unity of national sentiment.
The sitting of the Chamber of Deputies on
Saturday last afforded an example. All parties
sank their differences in face of the interna-
tional position. M. Ribot, who generally bores
the House with pious platitudes, sounded the
true national note when he said that his
party would stand by the Government. His
speech was applauded by the greater part of
the assembly and even those sitting under
the wing of M. Juares expressed a vehement
approval. M. Juares, who a few months ago
was the great god of the Extreme Left, ant
who evjn swayed the votes of the Left and
Left Centre, was cried down when he chose
this moment to tarn on a current of interna-
tionalism. It is for this reason that I regard
the closing debate of the extraordinary Session
of 1905 as one of the most significant in the
recent history of the French Parliament, and
as denoting the renaissance of French pa-
triotism.</p>
<p>This morning I had a conversation with a
leading official of one of the great railways
here. I was hardly prepared for his pessimism.
His outlook was most gloomy. “I see," he said,
“most of the conditions prevailing to-day that
were existing before the war. There is an
immense amount of spying being done. Let
me take one example. Out of fifteen thousand
working tailors employed in Paris, thirteen
thousand are foreigners, that is to say, persons
capable of giving information to an enemy. I
think in the present prevalence of strikes in
France we must see the hand of the trans-
Rhenal Power. An attempt, too, has been
made to tamper with public opinion through,
as I believe, the bribery of some organs of the
Press. Again, the trend oi legislation has been
most unfortunate, recalling the abortive efforts
of Marshal Niel to reorganise the army in 1869
-efforts that were entirely baulked, in my
opinion, by outside influences. Is not the two
years' service a most deplorable piece of work
in face of the actoal conditions? One might
suppose it to have been inspired—though I
am sure unconsciously—by a certain monarch
whose curious instability of temperament
constitutes the real danger of the situation."</p>

<p>One of the best-known English politicians
abroad is Lord Rosebery. He is a familiar
figure to Paris—less in recent years than in
days agone. He stays for the moment at
the Hotel Bristol. The Fourth Estate, as
is its wont, has sought to interview the great
man on the politics of the hour ; but his
lordship has passed on with a gracious "coup
de chapeau," leaving the sharpened pencil
and the notebook bereft of their prey. Lord
Rosebery is one of the few Englishmen belong-
ing to the Jockey Club, where he is an appre-
ciated visitor. It is the most exclusive
institution in Paris, and counts among its
members the King of England. Another
politician to interest the Parisians is un-
doubtedly John Burns. The Socialist writers
in the Press hail his advent to the Ministry
with a simple-hearted joy. They delight in
the details of his costume: the “ reefer " suit,
the bowler hat, and they wonder in their
innocence whether it will be proof against the
salary of his new position. Some suggest
that his ideas will change when the short
jacket lengthens to the frock coat.</p>
<p>France has seen seven presidential elections
since 1870, and an eighth will take place on
January 18, when M. Loubet lays down the
cares of an exalted office which none, perhaps,
of his predecessors has so much adorned. The
proximity of an event so important in the do-
mestic history of a nation linked to England
by close bonds of friendship may invest with a
certain passing interest the results of previous
presidential elections. In 1873 Marshal Mac-
Mahon’s majority was 196 ; that of M. Grevy
six years later was 335 ; and on his re-election
in 1885, 289. In 1887, M. Grevy having re-
tired as the sequel to the scandals connected
with the name of his son-in-law, M. Carnot
was elected by a majority of 414, after two
ballots. M. Casimir-Perier's majority in 1894
was 423— the largest majority recorded, and
when, a year later, M. Casimir-Perier retired,
in disgust with faction intrigues, M. Felix
Faure succeeded him with a majority of 401.
M. Loubet’s majority in 1899 was 407.</p>
<p>Cayenne, long a name of terror to the most
hardened of French criminals, will be so no
longer. Its days as a penal settlement are
well nigh over, though it is far from clear
that the measures proposed may not raise
difficulties of another kind in another quarter.
It has been definitely settled that Cayenne,
on account of its terrible climate, shall be
used as a penal colony no longer. But France
is far from renouncing such colonies. A mis-
sion, with the ex-director of the penitentiary
of French Guiana at its bead, has left for the
French possessions in Oceania to study the
most suitable site for establishing new convict
prisons. It is to be feared that the voice of
Australia will make itself heard should this
project be realised.</p></div>

<head>ARMY AND NAVY.</head>

<p>(From Our Correspondent).</p>
<p>London, December 22.</p>
<p>Lieutenant C. L. Smith, 2nd Battalion
Cornwall Light Infantry, Gibraltar, who has
just been formally seconded for service with
the Egyptian Army, earned the little cross
“For Valour" on that rad day at Jidballi,
when our forces were crumpled up by the spear-
men of the not so mad Mullah. Lieutenant
Smith, in the heat of the fight picked up the
badly wounded hospital orderly, in conjunction
with Lieutenant Welland, of the R.A.M.C., but
the native was killed before this could be
effected, and in retiring Lieutenant Welland
was daugoronaly wounded. The brave Smith
did all that mortal man could to bring his
brother officer to safety, and mounted him on
a horse and a mule in succession. Both mounts
were killed and finally Dr. Welland was spear-
ed. How Lieutenant Smith, who stood by his
friend to the last, escaped, was a marvel, but he
did so and had the honor of receiving the V.C.
in recognition of his gallantry.</p>
<p>Major H. Jellacorse, Royal Sussex Regiment,
who for the past five years was adjutant of the
1st Volunteer Battalion, Brighton, has taken
his retired pay after nineteen years’ service.
The vacant majority should go to Captain J.
F. P. Langdon, 2nd Battalion, Crete, and the
company will either be absorbed or go in the
1st Battalion at Umballa. It is hardly likely
that an outside officer will be brought in, as the
regiment has had two or three brought in in
recent years.</p>

<p>The Army Council has ruled that men of
the Royal Garrison Artillery serving on the
three years' enlistment engagement or who
have extended their service eight years
whilst on service abroad, and on arriving home
have still a few months to serve, may go at
once into the Army Reserve. This is a decided
concession to the gunner.</p>
<p>The Duke of Connaught, Inspector General,
has found it necessary to call the attention of
commanding offioers to the order against bang-
ing the butt of the rifle on the ground when
"ordering arms." The concussion produced by
the butt striking heavily on the ground must
affect injuriously the delicate breech mechan-
ism of the magazine rifle. In the olden days
with the Brown Bess, and in still more modern
times, with the Martini Henry, the greater the
"bang” the more smartly was the movement
made and the battalion got credit accordingly.
In fact it was impressed on the recruit that he
must make his rifle “tell." That is all changed
and no more “bang" is the word.</p>
<p>The minimum height of the recruits of the
Royal Garrison Artillery has been fixed at 5ft.
6in., which is a return to the days when the
Royal Regiment was composed of veritable
sons of Anak.</p>
<p>There are not wanting signs that the days
of the Royal Marines are numbered. Every-
thing points to their supersession in a com-
paratively short period.</p>
<p>It is expected that the new War Office,
Whitehall, will be occupied early in the New
Year, probably in February, or the beginning
of March. The departments farthest away from
the present War Office will first more into the
new quarters.</p></div>

        <head>OLD EGYPTIAN SEEDS.</head>
        <p>The vitality of seeds found in Egyptian
        mummy cases has often been questioned and
        recently the question was again revived owing
        to the results of experiments reported to the
        Paris Academy of Sciences, in which the
        general conclusion reached was that the length
        of the vitality was greatly increased if the
        seeds had no watery constituents. Whether
        seeds are capable of existing in a state of
        suspended animation for many hundreds of
        yean, as in the reputed instances of wheat ears
        drawn from mummy cases, is a question that
        has never been decisively answered. An investi-
        gation of the subject was made some years ago
        by Mr. John Philipson. The doubt first cast
        upon the genuineness of the specimens of wheat
        appears to have arisen from the fact that some
        seeds taken from a mummy case in Egypt and
        supposed to be grains of wheat, were submitted
        to examination and determined to belong to a
        species of maize, an American plant, said to be
        unknown to the ancient Egyptians. This neces-
        sitated the belief that the subjects of the
        Pharaohs were engaged in commerce with
        America some three thousand years ago. It is
        curious, however, that this maize differed from
        the common maize in having a much narrower
        seed and a highly developed calyz-and Mr.
        Philipson, after reviewing all the evidence
        regarding wheat ears of indisputably ancient
        origin, came to the conclusion that in three
        instances the development of wheat from them
        was proved ; and that, therefore the seeds, in
        the extremely favorable environment of pre-
        servation in mummy cases, had retained their
        vitality. The wheat produced had a compound
        spike by whioh it is readily distinguishable
        from ordinary wheat. If Mr. Philipson’s obser-
        vations and deductions are to be taken as
        entirely trustworthy then it is possible that we
        to-day might eat bread from the grain stored by
        Joseph for his Egyptian master.</p></div>

            <head>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</head>
            <p>Le Cairo, 28 decembre.</p>
            <p>Les valeurs égyptienues sout signalées en
            reprise à Londres; la National Bank a gagné
            hier 1/4 à 25 1/4 et l'Agricole 1/8 à 9 1/8. A
            Paris, le Crédit Foncier a également haussé de
            5 francs à 778.</p>
            <p>Ici, ce matin, notre marché a été relative-
            ment assez animé, avec de bonnes disposition
            L'Agricole, très demandée à 9 7/32, a c'ôturé
            à 9 1/4. La National Bank est négligée à
            25 7/32. L’action Crédit Foncier a été traitée
            à 779.</p>
            <p>L'action Agricole du Nil a gagné 4 francs à
            246. L’action Bourse Khédiviale du Caire a
            ouvert à £ 140 pour clôturer à 142 acheteurs.</p>
            <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, fortes transac-
            tions en Nungovich; on a ouvert à 11 1/8 pour
            monter à 11 1/2 et c’ôturer à 11 7/16 ven-
            deurs. Les Upper Egypt ont gagné 1/16 à
            5 1/16.</p>
            
            
           <p> Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptien,
            très recherchées, ont monté à 29 sh. 9 pour
            clôturer à 29. 6. Egalement mouvementés, les
            Salt and Soda ont clôturé à 20. 3. après avoir
            atteint 20. 6. Par contre, les Markets ont fléchi
            à 24.9.</p>	
            <p>Le brait court depuis hier, fort discrètement
            d'ailleurs, que la Société des Nungovich Hotels
            surait vendu à un groupe de capitalistes an-
            glais le Grand Continental Hotel.</p>
            <p>Cette rumeur est assurément inexacte, mais
            on rapporte qu’un syndicat anglais a offert à la
            Société £ 420,000 environ pour l'acquisition
            de cet hôtel, sut l’èmplacement duquel il se
            proposerait d’élever des galeries avec magasins
            et maisons de rapport.</p>
            <p>Si cette proposition à été faite, elle sera pro-
            bablement soumise à l’assemblée-générale des
            actionnaires qui la refuserait sans aucun doute.</p>
            <p>Le bruit avait couru à Londres, il y a quel-
            ques mois, que l’Egyptian Trust and Invest-
            ment avait l’intention de distribuer, vera la fin
            d’octobre, un dividende intérimaire de 5 %, Ce
            dividende devait être prélevé sur les bénéfices
            déjà réalisés par la Société.</p>
            <p>Or, M. Glymenopoulos fait annoncer que la
            loi anglaise s'oppose à ce qu'aucun dividende
            soit distribué avant la fin de l’exercice de la
            Société, qui fiuit le 29 mars prochain.</p>
            <p>Nous avons eu dernièrement l’occasion de
            rappeler que les statuts de l’Egyptian Improve-
            ments Corporation prévoient la clûture du
            premier exercioe, commencé en mai 1905, pour
            le 81 décembre de l’année prochaine.</p>
            <p>Or, il se oonfirme que le oonseil d’administra-
            tion de cette Société a décidé de provoquer au
            plus vite la Convocation d’une Assemblée géné-
            rale extraordinaire après le règlement des
            comptes de fin courant, afin de proposer d’ar-
            rêter le premier exercice au 31 décembre 1905
            et de fixer un dividende de 10 % sur le capital
            versé.</p>
            <p>On proposerait aussi à cette assemblée l'aug-
            mentation du capital actions dès que le dernier
            quart serait appelé, ainsi que la création d’un
            capital obligations, pour lequel la Société est
            déjà en pourparlers.</p>
            <p>Ces propositions sont motivées : 1. par le
            fait que les bénéfices réalisés à ce jour per-
            mettent aisément, en amortissant d'un seul
            coup le compte de premier établissement,
            d’ailleurs peu important, de distribuer le divi-
            dende de 10% précité, en reportant à nouveau
            une certaine somme ; 2 en ce qui concerne
            l’augmentation projetée du capital, par quel-
            ques grosses opérations qui se présentent dans
            les conditions les plus avantageuses pour la
            Société.</p>
            
            <p>Les cours de coton arrivent en baissé sen-
            sible d’Amérique. Le spot a perdu hier 15
            points, le Janvier 22 et le Mai 24. Le marché
            de Liverpool est également en mauvaise ten-
            dance.</p>
            <p>Suivant des télégrammes que nous recevons
            de New-York, la baisse serait déterminée, d’une
            part, par la nouvelle que les planteurs se
            préposeraient d’étendre encore leur acréage ;
            d’autre part, par le fait que l’estimation du
            "come into sight" pour les mois de janvier
            et février serait supérieure à celle de l’aunée
            dernière.</p>
            <p>Ici, le Mars a ouvert ce matin à 15 5/8
            pour clôturer à 15 9/16.</p>

                  <head>GERMAN BANKS IN THE LEVANT.</head>
                  <p>“Herr von Streit, the Director-General of the
                  Greek-National Bank, has made a declaration,”
                  writes the Athens correspondent of the Frank-
                  furter Zeitung, "concerning the changes that
                  are to be expected in the recently founded
                  Banque d’Orient on the creation of the new
                  Deutsche-Orientbank. ‘The Greek National
                  Bank,’ says Herr von Streit, 'only concurred in
                  the foundation of the Banque d’Orient in order
                  to put an end to the entire interruption of busi-
                  ness relations with Germany that had been
                  caused by the State bankruptcy and at the same
                  time to see itself side by side with the bank of a
                  powerful nation in Turkey.’ Perfect equality in
                  business relations was established between the
                  two banks at the time the company was formed,
                  but only on receiving the assurance that the
                  Greek element should have the preponderance
                  in the conduct and direction of business
                  transactions. Difficulties arose, however, from
                  the action of the Nationalbank für Deutsch-
                  land in seeking to influence the selection of
                  the personnel of the governing board, and so
                  interfering with the unity and promptitude of
                  its action, and that in the interest of the
                  German element—a course of action which the
                  Greek National Bank naturally opposed."</p>
                  <p>The solution of the difficulty now proposed
                  is that the Banque d'Orient should be left
                  entirely to the management ot the Athenian
                  Board, on whish Greek preponderance should
                  be assured. The Banque d'Orient would retain
                  its branches in Smyrna, Salonica, Alexandria,
                  and Cairo, while the branches in Constantinople
                  and Hamburg would be handed over to the
                  Nationalbank für Deutschland for further
                  cession to the Deutsche Orientbank.</p>

may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and
possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March
it will be warmer than Rome, and more uni-
formly warm than many other places in Europe.
Many people leave Egypt far too early in the
year; for as a rule the weather in April and
May is perfect. The warmest place to go to
on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>

<p>Some will want to take into consideration
the number of days to be spent at sea, and we
therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc-
cupied on each of the various routes between
Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>They are as follows :-</p>

<p>The long sea routes-from Port Said or
Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton, London
or Liverpool-occupy about 14 days. The
short ones are as follows:-</p>

<p>Port Said or ALexandria to Brindisi   3 days
Alexandria to Messina... ... ...      3 "
Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles 5 "
Alexandria to Venice and Trieste      4 "
Alexandria to Naples... ...           3 "
Port Said to Genoa  ... ... ...       5 "
Port Said to Naples... ... ...        4 "
Alexandria to Constantinople ...      4 "
Alexandria to Piraeus ... ... ...     2 "
Port Said to Gibraltar... ... ...     7 "</p>

<p>The steamers, of the P. & 0. North German
Lloyd, Orient and Messageries Mari times
are the largest. The Anchor, British India,
and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their
steamers are largely patronised by travellers
to Egypt.</p>

<p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo,
the shortest is that to Alexandria, without
change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now
be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>The least expensive way to England is by
the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool.
The German Levant line has also good steamers
from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>

<p>The most expensive but quickest through
Continental routes are by P. & O. Brindisi
express from Port Said, and the Austrian
Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>

<p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne
in mind that very little luggage is allowed
free on the railways of Europe, but there are
several good and responsible forwarding agents
in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>

<p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe
from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast
Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi.
One of these leaves Port Said every week, as
soon as possible after receiving the Indian
mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>

<p>These small but comfortable ships have
enormously powerful engines, and attain a
very high rate of speed. They are called the
"ferry boats," having been specially built to
carry the British mail from Port Said to
Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
England you will find the train waiting at
Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
changing. It has complete arrangements for
sleeping and eating on board, and you should
arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving
Port Said.</p></div>

<div><head>SICILY.</head>

<p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-
Rubattino Co.'s steamers which leave Alex-
andria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes
train to TAORMINA, one of the most charm-
ing and popular places on the island. Giardini
is he station at which to alight, and the drive
up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying
about one hour. In and around the town is
much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of
Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that
are found all over the island, are an endless
sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
interesting history, having been a Greek
city, which was designed by Demostheues in
B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in b.c. 212,
when Archimedes was slain in his tomb is to be
seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan
temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000
inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest
is to be found in this fine city. The Polazzo
Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the
church of S Giovannia degli Eremiti with its
picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral Museum,
Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park
are also worth a visit.</p>

<head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>

<p>The fine steamers of the North German
Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
during the season for Naples, the voyage
being only 3 days.</p>

<p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from
Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam-
ers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
Naples or leave it without wishing to explore
some of its island, besides the lovely places
on its Bay— Castellamare and Sorrento. The
small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you
can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>

<p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of
but five hours. All who can will devote at
least one week to visiting the many historical
and interesting portions of the Eternal City,
whose charms and beauties are too well-known
to need comment here.</p>

<p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret,
a railway journey of five hours brings you to
FLORENCE, where another week can well be
spent admiring the City of Flowers and its
surrounding country. In Florence itself the
churches and galleries are of absorbing inte-
rest, whilst the local promenades and excur-
sions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
the most attractive and fashionable promenade
in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of
the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
ago, goes winding up through the hills a
distance of four miles. The most delightful
excursion outside Florence is that to Vallom-
brosa; with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the
sea level. This is made first by ordinary train
from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-
wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through
groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

<p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in
about 2 hours ; here there is a fine Cathedral
and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one
night should if possible be made, in order to
enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.</p>

<p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful
places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and on
the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a
very convenient half-way house between Egypt
and England, and where living is reasonable
and the air and surroundings exceptionally
good.</p></div>

<div><head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>

<p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most
picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
the record of having one of the lowest
death averages of European cities and a
phenomenally equable temperature—warm in
winter and deliciously cool breezes from the
surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean
in summer.</p>

<p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most an-
eient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and
famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and
paintings, are a constant delight to thousands
of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
Then there are the superbly decorated medie-
val churches containing exquisite marble
columns and historical paintings, and the in-
comparable Campo Santo filled with its won-
derful tombs.</p>

<p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only
three hours by rail.</p>

<p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy
before making the tour of the Lakes. The
Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its
beautiful windows illustrating the History of
the Bible. The public gardens and the monu-
mental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

<p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an
hour and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAG-
GIORE, a renowned health resort on account
of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo
San Domingo and in half-an-hour you are at
Salsomaggiore.</p>



<head>NORTHERN ITALY (continued)
and
The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>

<p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from
Milan, and one of the most delightful places
imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total
absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very
strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is
to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life
at every turn. The approach to Venice from
the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea-
port. The town seems to be gradually, like
Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
stretches of rock, but the first the tops of Cam-
paniles appear above the horizon, then slowly
the whole glittering town rises like a fairy
mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>

<p>Going northwards from Milan you make the
tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>

<p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny,
is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train
by way of Monza.</p>

<p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other
towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and
the scenery on either side going up the lake is
most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming
spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and
Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo
along the shore of the lake to Managgio is most
enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio
to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-
three-quarter hours.</p></div>

<div><head>SWITZERLAND</head>

<p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been
described as "A cluster of delights and
grandeurs."</p>

<p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and
reached by train in one-and-a-half- hours. It has
a population of 10,000 people and is charm-
ingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst
lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>

<p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from
Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town,
situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a
mild climate, and is an excellent winter resort.
The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above
the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interest-
ing paintings, "Entombment," by Ciseri, and
"The Flight into Egypt" by Bramantion.</p>

<p>LUCERNE- A striking picture on the Lake
of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus and
the snow-clad Alps.</p>

<p>In and around the town the walks are
charming, and the excursions to be made from
Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>

<p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful
excursions, those to the Rigi, Pilatus, Burgen-
stock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit
each. Other excursions on the lake can be
made by steamer, and the ever-changing
scenery on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is
a source of delight to the lover of nature.</p>

<p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the
most beautiful part of the Lake of Lucerne,
commands magnificent views of lake and
mountain scenery. Along the Lake of Uri
from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous
Axentrasse.</p>

<p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is
that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to Stansstad
and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and
40 min. by Electric Railway, with delightful
scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis is
made from here, and the panoramic view of
the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the
Santis to the Matterhous.</p>

<p>THE BERNESE OBERLAND-INTER-
LAKEN a favourite summer resort and the best
centre for making excursions in the Oberland,
abounding in fine walks and views. There is
a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the
Hoheweg, a fine avenue of walnut trees the
chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach,
Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then also the
glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren
and the Schynige Platte are sights not to be
missed.</p>

<p>Chateau D'Oex. 3500 ft. above the sea
on the new Electric Railway between Montreaux
and Interlaken, surrounded by magnificent
scenery, with pure dry air. Much frequented
by English people in Summer and Winter.</p></div>

<div><head>GREEK AND IONIAN ISLES</head>
<p>Many people visit Greece after wintering
in Egypt, as it is so easily reached from Alex-
andria; the climate in April is charming. The
best steamers are those of the Khedivial Mail
Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>

<p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in
Athens for the Orthodox Easter in order to
witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve
ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing
on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara
for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>

<p>It is worth while to spend a few days in
CORPU on account of the beauty of the
scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
shooting to be had.</p></div>
