                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are intended to leave

              Assouan, with a number of tourists on board,

              fatally, stabbed a native carpenter in the Labbane
              quarter of Alexandria a few weeks ago, took
              place at the Native Court of Alexandria, the
              man being an Ottoman subject. The accused,

              all stations for four or more years, and the
              information obtained makes it possible to
              undertake more thoroughly the study of the
              factors which determine the Nile Flood, in
              co-operation with the Meteorological Services
              of surrounding countries. In 1906 it is proposed
              to devote more time to this question, in order
              to see what information from other areas can
              be most usefully employed in estimating the

              the authority of the G. O. C. in Egypt, which
              is bulkier than its predecessors and contains
              a mass of information useful to residents in
              Egypt. The January edition will be ready for
              sale about the 15th prox. Should any errors or
              omissions be observed in the present edition it
              is requested that these be at once brought to
              the notice of the “Clerk-in-charge, The

              <p>African World Annual.
              We have received the "African World”
              Christmas Annual, a bulky production of about
              300 folio pages packed full of interesting
              information regarding every part of Africa,
              from the Cape to Cairo. Though the contents
              are mainly devoted to South African mining,
              a section which is of the utmost value to those
              interested in these ventures, space is found
              for a whole series of ably written and specially
              contributed articles, dealing with almost every
              phase of African activity—whether it be on
              mining, or on sport, politics, and travel. The
              literary value of the publication is very high
              and it is most profusely illustrated with photo-
              graphs and sketches. The editors and compilers,
              Messrs. Leo Weinthal, Hartley Knight, and
              Moses Roberts, are to be congratulated on a
              marvellously fine production. It costs 2s, and
              should be in the hands of all those interested
              in any part of this continent.</p></div>

              <head>THE PORTE’S CLAIMS.</head>
              <head>A TURCO-EGYPTIAN DISPUTE.</head>

              <p>A dispute between the Egyptian and Turkish
              Governments respecting the frontier separat-
              ing Egypt from the Benghazi District is report-
              ed by a Constantinople correspondent. Last
              year the Turkish Government caused barracks
              for a company of infantry to be erected at
              the further end of the Gulf of Sollom, from
              which the line of demarcation between Egypt
              and the district of Benghazi starts. The
              barracks, however, were erected at a point
              situated a little beyond the Turkish frontier,
              and the Khedive's Government therefore pro-
              tested against this encroachment by Turkish
              troops on Eyptian territory.</p>

              <p>To this the Porte only answered that there
              could be no question of any encroachment on
              a foreign soil on the part of Turkey, “since
              the villayet (province) of Egypt formed an
              integral part of the Ottoman Empire.”</p>

              <p>The sophistry of this argument did not
              escape the Egyptian Government. In order
              both to force the Turkish garrison in the
              barracks to quit Egyptian soil and to restore
              to Egypt her rights of territorial sovereignty
              not only over the entire district of Sollom but
              also over a district of about 250 kilometres to
              the west of that point, it is causing an Egyp-
              tian military post to be constructed at the
              farther end of the Bay of Bomba.</p>

              <p>The erection, therefore, of this Egyptian
              military post at Bomba will have for result
              the acquisition by Egypt of a considerable area.
              The frontier between Egypt and the Turkish
              district of Benghazi, which began, as the maps
              indicate, at Sollon, will now start from the
              Bay of Bomba, that is to say, will include
              about 250 kilometres more in the direction of
              the west.</p>

              <p>Recently the Turkish Council of Ministers
              discussed this question at great length, and
              decided that the Grand Vizier should address a
              communication directly to the Egyptian
              Government calling on it to give up the project.
              The Governor of Benghazi, Hilmy Pasha, has,
              on his side, received orders, to oppose by any
              means he may consider necessary the erection
              by the Egyptians of a military post at Bomba,
              supposing the Khedivial Government should
              refuse to take into consideration the communi-
              cation of the Grand Vizier.</p>

              <p>According to Turkish intelligence, an Egyp-
              tian despatch boat has been chosen to convey
              to Bomba the Egyptian soldiers whose duty it
              will be to erect the military post and thus to
              isolate from Benghazi the Turkish barracks at
              Sollom.</p>

              <p>The above statements emanate from Con-
              stantinople and we have not obtained con-
              firmation of them from any authorised Egyptian
              source.</p></div>

              <head>DJELLALEDDIN PASHA’S PROTEST TO THE SULTAN.</head>

              <p>The death of the Khedivial Princess who
              was the wife of General Ahmed. Djelaleddin
              Pasha and the sister of Prince Omar Pasha
              and Prince Djemil Pasha Toussoun, is still
              fresh in the minds of all, for the funeral, which
              took place at Alexandria, was one of the most
              solemn and largely attended inhumations that
              have taken place here for years past. Her body
              rests in the Mosque of Nebi Daniel.</p>

              <p>Since her death her husband, who for more
              than ten years was the most powerful and
              honorable of the Sultan's advisors, has re-
              sided in Egypt and resisted all the blandish-
              ments of the Sublime Porte to induce him to
              go back to Stamboul. His obstinacy has led, it
              is said, to the confiscation of his estates in
              Turkey, and now the Sultan has determined to
              blacken the character of his erstwhile favorite
              by ordering a commission to sit at Yildiz
              Kiosque in order to enquire into the circum-
              stances attending his wife's death. The Pasha’s
              case is fully set out in the telegram which he
              despatched to Tahsin Pasha, first secretary to
              the Sultan, on the 26th inst. The text of this
              despatch is as follows .—</p>

              po'icières de la ville de Cannes, cu elle a
              rendu le dernier soupir. Tous ses parents,
              l'illusure famille á laquelle elle appartenait,
              sont domiciliés dans ce pays et j'y suis établi
              moi-même, principal intéressé. La haute re-
              nommés de justice et d’impartialité des tri-
              bunaux égyptiens demeurant au-dessus de
              toute contestation il serait donc tout-à-fait
              naturel de poursuivre ce procès en Egypte, ce
              qui assurerait l’exaltation entière de la vérité.</p>

              <p>Pourtant, si par une considération queloon-
              que le recours aux tribunaux égyptiens était
              jugé inopportun on rourrait parfaitement
              déférer le cas à la justice française, la prince se
              étant morte en France. Au surplus, je suis
              prêt à me présenter à la justice de tout pays
              civilisé où l'indépendance des tribunaux se
              tronve assurée.</p>

              <p>Mais la manière par laquelle l’enquête est
              inaugurée à Constantinople, la constitution
              d’une commission au palais de Yildiz, qui ne
              devrait en rien intervenir dans une affaire
              judiciaire, la pression exercée sur certains mé-
              decins (parmi lesquels d’auouns n’avaient d’ail-
              leurs jamais examiné la défunte princesse)pour
              leur faire apposer leurs signatures au-dassous
              d'un rapport préslablement préparé, les mena-
              ces proférées à cette occasion constituent au-
              tant de symptômes indiquant que l’enquête
              poursuivie à Constantinople marque, dans son
              origine même, de cette incérité dans la recher-
              che de la vérité qui constitue la condition
              essentielle de toute justice régulière.</p>

              <p>Aussi, il devieut indispensable dans l’intérêt
              même du but pousuivi de trausférer le procès
              devant une justice inaccessible à aucune ingé-
              rence et dont la procédure normale ne saurait
              subir aucune déviation.</p>

              <p>Cette proposition ne peut qu’être adoptée,
              s’il existe la moindre impartialité dans l’en-
              quête inaugurêe. Le triomphe de ceux qui la
              poursuiventrerait incontestables’ils parvenaient
              à obtenir une condemnation d’un tribunal
              jugeant en pleine possession de son indépen-
              dance. Le refus, au contraire, de porter l'affaire
              devant une justice impartiale, découvrirait de
              suite le but caché qui ne peut être autre chose
              que de porter une grave atteinte à ma dignité
              et à mon honneur. Ce sont là justement les
              seuls biens auquels je tiens dans l’exil volon-
              taire que je me suis imposé. En présence d’une
              pareille entreprise qui sous imposé d'une
              procès absurde, équivaut à déclarer une guerre
              ouverte contre mon honneur, toute considera-
              tion de convenance, tout souvenir d’anciennes
              bienveillances cessent d'avoir leur raison d'être.
              La responsabilité de cette nouvelle situation
              ne peut révenir qu’a ceux qui m’obligent de
              me départir de la neutralité que je me suis
              imposée vis-à-vis du vrai instigateur de ces
              intrignes. J'accepterai le combat et j'attendral
              avec confiance les hostilités pour défendre mon
              honneur et lui conserver dans le monde
              l’estime et la considération dont je suis fier
              da le voir entouré. Ce sera une nouvelle
              occasion pour manifester la puissance morale
              de l’honneur et affirmer son triomphe contre
              toute force qui voudrait l'écraser injustement.</p>

              <p>An Englishman, who knew the Pasha at
              Constantinople, thus describes him:-</p>

              <p>Djellaleddin Pasha was for years foremost
              and prime favorite among all the Sultan’s
              subjects, and fully deserved the trust
              reposed in him as an honorable and upright
              gentleman. His downfall, therefore, came as a
              shock to all who knew him, the greater,
              perhaps, for that the report added that
              he had been denounced by the Secret Police
              of the Palace, a force which he himself created
              and organised, and of which, among many
              offices, he has always been the working chief.
              A remarkable and singularly fascinating per-
              sonality, Ahmed Pasha’s most salient quality
              was ever an absolutely whole-hearted devotion
              to his master and when at last the enemies who
              ever dog the footsteps of Royal favorites
              succeeded in alienating from him Abdul
              Hamid’s confidence and affection, the cir-
              cumstance was received aa indicating a further
              sinister advance in the progress of that be-
              setting "manie de la persécution” which has
              for years haunted the gloomy potentate of
              Yildiz. During his long term of honored ser-
              vice Ahmed Pasha enjoyed an absolutely
              unique position in the Yildiz set. Privileges
              have been his which no other Turkish function-
              ary would have dared to solicit. Of late years, for
              instance, social communion between Turks and
              Europeans in the capital has been tacitly, and in
              some cases openly, prohibited. Yet Ahmed was
              a prominent member of the “English" club,
              and to which practically all the English colony
              belongs in common with the chief members of
              other European communities. Almost every
              day, indeed, Fridays excepted, during the
              many years I knew him, Ahmed Pasha took
              his place at the Bridge table—for Bridge was
              popular in Constantinople long before it was
              heard of in Europe, and it may be said that he
              is both a fine player and a good loser. It has
              often been suggested that this licensed associa-
              tion with Europeans was not wholly foreign to
              his functions as chief of the Secret Police. As to
              this, however, it may be said that all who have
              known the Pasha were penetrated with the
              sense of his complete honorability. In proof
              of this is the fact that when Abdul Hamid
              sought to end his differences with the
              chiefs in Paris of the ” Young Turkey ”
              party he employed in vain one intermediary
              after another until it was intimated to him
              that the services of Ahmed Djellaleddin as
              envoy would procure the desired result. The
              Pasha, therefore, was sent to Paris and on
              his representations the ” Young Turkey ”
              leaden complied with the Sultan’s invitation
              that they should return to Constantinople and
              their allegiance. It is noteworthy in this
              connection that Ahmed's influence with his
              master has sufficed to assure to them the
              immunity that he promised. It is within my
              knowledge that on several occasions he has
              been urged to diverge from this line of con-
              duct, and that at the risk of that loss
              of favor which has now overtaken him he
              invariably refused to put his hand to any
              unworthy action. Oddly enough, until now
              this inflexibility has served rather than injur-
              ed him in his master’s eyes : for the Sultan,
              though freely using spies and traitors, has
              a wholesome contempt for such gentry. Cover-
              ed with honors, only before his fall from
              favor recently, indeed, the Sultan bestowed
              on him the last and highest decoration in his
              gift.</p></div>

              was in such a bad state that the S.S Willis

              Zifta, Thursday.</p>

              <p>A meeting was held to-day, in a large tent
              near the Zifta Markaz, of the omdehs, mer-
              chants, and notables of the town and surround-
              ing villages. The Sub-Moudir of Gharbieh,
              Abdel Ghani Bey Shakir, the Mamour of Zifta,
              Hafez Effendi Amin, and many other notables
              were present. The Sub-Moudir opened the
              proceedings by a speech explaining the object
              of the gathering and urging them to help the
              kuttabs and their arifs, as many benefits were
              to be derived from them. The inspector of the
              kuttabs of Lower Egypt, Sheikh Mohamed
              Nassar, then said something as to the advant-
              ages of learning and education, their effect upon
              civilisation, the uses of the new kuttabs, and
              the necessity of spreading knowledge among
              Egyptians.</p>

              <p>The inspector of the kuttabs of the markaz
              also delivered a speech dealing with the new
              method of teaching in the kuttabs, and also
              recalled the Prophet’s sayings on the subject,
              pointing out that these new methods of teaching
              were the same as those enjoined by the Koran.
              He mentioned that there are now about
              sixty kuttabs in the district of Zifta at-
              tended by 3,528 scholars, of whom 105 are
              girls. He added that there was only one kut-
              tab in the whole district in 1902.</p>

              <p>Afterwards the grants-in-aid which amount-
              ed to about LE 245, were distributed and the

              the markaz, under the presidency of the Wakil
              el moudirieh of Gharbieh and two Public In-
